			<description><![CDATA[Connections Planner Job Specification

 

The Role

 

R/GA is looking for a statistically driven Connections Planner to join their media and connections team in New York to work on its various accounts.

 

The Connections Planner will be involved in seeking new way for our clients to more intelligently invest their media dollars.  We"ve moved away from traditional media plans to now creating media systems, where data, algorithms, and optimization play a central role, before, during and after a campaign.

 

On your accounts, you will lead our efforts in modeling media data to identify and evaluate different media spend strategies, and then you will use these models to work closely with media planner/buyers to activate and manage the campaigns. You"ll also work closely with our Bid Manager to plug these media systems into the range of electronic markets and exchanges we deal with through our trading desk to maximize returns for our clients.


This is a great role for a candidate with a real love of numbers to apply your knowledge in a fast paced digital environment. 

 

Key Responsibilities:

 

Day to day your tasks will differ, but your core responsibilities will include:



Researching and analyzing media data for active clients and projects

Aiding senior members of the team to develop research methods and tools

Preparing and giving presentations on your findings

Working closely with clients

Working closely with other members of the media team, namely: media planners/buyers, search strategists, and our bid manger on our trading desk

Working closely across the agency with: creatives, our analytics department, strategic planners, technologists, as well as account and production staff.

Mentoring junior team members, development and career progression



 

So what are we looking for?



A real love of numbers! Ideally your academic background is likely to be MSc level in either mathematics, statistics, economics, or econometrics

Excellent communication skills (although this is a VERY numerical role - you need to be confident when it comes to presenting and explaining your findings to 'less technical' people too - Communicating is KEY)

The ability to convert analysis into real world actionable solutions

Excellent knowledge of Excel, common econometrics packages and PowerPoint

			<description><![CDATA[R/GA, The Agency for the Digital Age, is now ramping up it's staff in San Francisco! 

R/GA is a full-service agency for the digital age. We work by asking "What do consumers want?" and then following wherever the answer leads. That can mean anything from crafting an outbound message to creating a utility or an interactive engagement. It can also mean inventing something new. To learn more, please visit us online at www.rga.com 

The ideal candidate is a visual designer who can envision design solutions from the big picture to the smallest details of a design system. Someone who can get a brand and/or a conceptual direction and "see" how it translates in terms of colors, layouts, fonts, pictures and storytelling, and moreover, how this expands and translates in all levels of a design solution. 

This designer will understand how the direction has a life in multiple channels, and how visuals can both be represented in different format, and make a seamless connection between multiple channels. Finally, this designer is someone who can understand the complexity behind a communications strategy, and transform it in a simple, strong and powerful system that a group of other designers can use for developing consistent branded content.
 
R/GA is committed to pursuing diversity, inclusion and fairness at every level of our organization. We believe in valuing the differences of all our employees.

Someone who has a solid design foundation with an understanding of layout, typography, grids. Have a strong mobile background; functioning as a kind of  UI expert, knowing and understanding multiple operating systems and getting very hands-on with pixel/dp perfect dimensions, scalings and saving multiple assets.

 This Designer will be the overseer of all mobile assets within this brand's application universe.

As a Senior Verbal Identity Specialist  in the Brand Development Group at R/GA, you"ve got the passion and know-how to distill wide-ranging input into spot-on verbal identity copy that"s anywhere in length from a single word to an entire Web site.

You"re able to walk the walk and talk the talk with B2C and B2B clients up to at least mid-management levels in a wide range of industries, and you"re comfortable working closely with all manner of creatives &mdash; visual, interaction, technology, video, more. Ultimately, you"re exceptionally fluent in translating ideas from planners, strategists, researchers, producers and account directors into powerfully expressive language.
 
Duties and Responsibilities




Lead verbal identity projects with diverse creative and strategic teams, and concept and collaborate on larger brand identity projects

Write and direct compelling, clear and grammatically tight long- and short-form copy

Express ideas in multiple styles and voices for numerous formats, online and off

Hit deadlines and meet client criteria

Present work to clients at various levels

Mentor junior talent

Ability to accept and incorporate constructive, team-based criticism and make contributions to positive group chemistry &mdash; internal as well as with clients

Willingness to help build a brand department from the ground up

Clearly demonstrated belief that branding is about more than words and visuals



 
Experience
 



Up to 10 years spent on a verbal identity / branding or related career path with an innovative body of work that includes but isn"t limited to:



&ndash;      Messaging examples: voice, tone, strategy, story, architecture, positioning, etc.
&ndash;      Naming examples (or exposure to the process): organization, product, service, etc.
&ndash;      Brand implementation: guidelines development, general supervision, etc.

The Digital Advertising Group is a small team of innovation driven creatives, flash programmers and production specialists creating bleeding-edge work for our Fortune-500 clients. We are regularly setting new standards (literally!) in the industry, creating media, sites, video and games that are so forward-thinking, they haven"t even made it up on our own site yet.
 
We need a skilled and dedicated, self-motivated designer/developer &mdash; or as Adobe prefers to call this person, a "Devigner." What we"re looking for: A person to join our team who is excited about trying new things, who loves to create cool little widgets, who is not afraid of learning and teaching and sharing, who has an eye for design and an "ear" for rhythm in their work (especially important with online advertising!), and who is interested in becoming part of our family of developers.
 
What we"d love for you to be open to: Learning our methodology for programming and our process. Sharing your experience with the Internet at large. Teaching us what you have learned through your years of building stuff.
 
If you"re looking for a great, fulfilling experience on a daily basis, please get in touch.

3) Experience integrating video into online media.
 
4) A general understanding of Rich Media specs, best practices and definitions. Experience with Rich Media vendor templates, practices & API"s a huge plus.
 
5) A working knowledge of Photoshop/Fireworks. Illustrator, After Effects and 3D also a plus.

<p>
The Media Analyst will be involved in seeking new ways for our clients to more intelligently invest their media dollars.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve moved away from traditional media plans to now creating media systems, where data, algorithms, and optimization play a central role, before, during and after a campaign.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
On your accounts, you will lead our efforts in modeling media data to identify and evaluate different media spend strategies, and then you will use these models to work closely with media planner/buyers to activate and manage the campaigns. You&rsquo;ll also work closely with our Bid Manager to plug these media systems into the range of electronic markets and exchanges we deal with through our trading desk to maximize returns for our clients.<br />
<br />
This is a great role for a candidate with a real love of numbers to apply your knowledge in a fast paced digital environment.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Key Responsibilities:</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Day to day your tasks will differ, but your core responsibilities will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Researching and analyzing media data for active clients and projects</li>
<li>
Developing research methods and tools</li>
<li>
Preparing and giving presentations on your findings</li>

Mentoring &amp; managing team members, development and career progression</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />
<strong>So what are we looking for?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
A real love of numbers! Ideally your academic background is likely to be MSc level in either&nbsp;mathematics,&nbsp;statistics, economics, or econometrics</li>
<li>
Excellent communication skills (although this is a VERY numerical role - you need to be confident when it comes to presenting and explaining your findings to &#39;less technical&#39; people too - Communicating is KEY)</li>
<li>
The ability to convert analysis into real world actionable solutions</li>
<li>
Excellent knowledge of Excel, common econometrics packages and PowerPoint</li>
