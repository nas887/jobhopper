	<li>
		Have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in computer science or equivalent &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p>
	<strong>An IDEAL candidate will also have:</strong></p>
<ul>

		Agile development: We ship code fast, measure user response, and iterate fast.</li>
	<li>
		Continuous integration: unit tests run on every check-in.</li>

		Almost all our code is written in Ruby.</li>
	<li>
		Our entire infrastructure is automated with Puppet</li>
	<li>
		You will ship production code on the first day of your job. So by Day 2, your code will have been run by more than a million people!</li>
