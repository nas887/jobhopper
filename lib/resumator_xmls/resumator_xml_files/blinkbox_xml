ABOUT BLINKBOX<br />
blinkbox is the UK&#39;s leading independent online film and TV aggregator. Since its launch the company has amassed a catalogue of over 9,000 of the world&#39;s best film and TV titles from top tier studios including BBC Worldwide, Warner Bros., Universal, Paramount, Sony Pictures Television International, Twentieth Century Fox and more than 15 leading independent producers such as FremantleMedia, All3Media, Revolver, Zig Zag and Aardman Animations.<br />
With an audience of over 2 million unique users a month, blinkbox.com combines premium programming with leading edge technology into a simple user interface across multiple consumer platforms. The company offers both buy-to-own and watch-for-free services where consumers can buy or rent the latest releases or watch free TV, all streamed instantaneously to PC, Mac, TV and more recently, games consoles and mobile devices.<br />
Based in London, blinkbox was founded by former Channel 4 and Vodafone senior executives, with a vision to create the only truly personalized and engaging entertainment service for communities passionate about TV and movies.</p>
<p>
ABOUT THE IT GROUP<br />
The IT group is responsible for all IT hardware and software platforms within blinkbox Entertainment. This includes strategy, implementation and maintenance of systems serving the office users, through to our 2 million+ monthly customers.<br />
The core production platform is based on Microsoft technologies atop commodity Wintel hardware and shared storage devices. Additional software by encoding and DRM providers completes the base software stack upon which the website is run.<br />
No blinkbox IT services are outsourced, so engineers must be prolific trouble shooters, and comfortable with tackling a problem from detection to resolution. For the same reason, engineers must be highly capable in a number of fields and eager to learn the latest platforms and technologies as they emerge.</p>
<p>
ABOUT THE ENGINEERING GROUP<br />
The development teams we have include database, services, front end web and player technologies. All engineers are required to be able to work across a wide range of technologies; from back end multithreaded encoding services through RESTful APIs to front end web development that targets specific low-resource consumer electronic devices.<br />
The test team is dedicated to ensuring the code and solutions we ship are of the highest quality. Using manual and automated tests from simple code fragments up to automated smoke tests, they verify the quality of the shipping code across a wide range of devices. All of the engineering resources liaise with the Operations team to ensure smooth delivery and support of the blinkbox solution.<br />
The architecture team is a small team that has input at all levels of the solution. The team ensure that all technology and information decisions are made with a full understanding of the impact across the wider technology group and the company as a whole.</p>
<p>
ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE TEAM<br />
The performance team is a specialist function within the IT group, with the aim of providing a number of services to the wider Technology group.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Assisting software developers in writing high performance code at every level</li>
<li>
Creating a toolset to monitor, measure, alert and report on performance trends and anomalies from the users&rsquo; perspective, and within the service and data layers</li>
<li>
Analysis of user feedback to identify areas of improvement</li>
<li>
Creating a set of standards within the Technology groups to maintain the creation of high performance services, systems and applications</li>
</ul>
<p>
With all of the above in mind, the performance team must both lead by example, and influence stakeholders at every technical level to develop a culture of high performance throughout.<br />
Since performance is a cross-cutting concern, team members are multi-skilled and have a broad view of the practicalities of building and running an application at web scale on the Microsoft platform. However, it is understood that applicants are likely to be from either a software development background or a systems and infrastructure background and so a degree of specialisation is expected, with applicants bringing deep skills in the areas appropriate to their specialism.</p>
