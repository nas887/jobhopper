	<li>
		Database, application architecture and software system design experience</li>
	<li>
		Experience with interpretive languages ( Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP )</li>
	<li>
		Python, linux, mysql experience is a PLUS</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Skills</strong></p>
<ul>

		Excellent problem solving skills</li>
	<li>
		A firm grasp on http client/server interaction, data structures, and computer science fundamentals</li>
	<li>

</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Education</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Computer science related degree OR equivalent professional experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Compensation (DOE)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Monetary Compensation will be low for the first 3 to 6 months. (We are an early stage startup in the midst of raising funds.)</li>
	<li>
		Equity Compensation will be generous.</li>
	<li>
		Exciting Work Environment (We are a relatively young team sharing an open office space with several other startups.)</li>
