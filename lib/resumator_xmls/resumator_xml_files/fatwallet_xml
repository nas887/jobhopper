So you don&#39;t see a listing for a position that fits your skills, but you&#39;d still like to introduce yourself? This is the place to do so.</p>
<p>
If you found this form, you were rather persistent. Persistence can be a great trait to possess and often something we look for in potential employees. Once you submit your resume, you will receive an automated response saying we&#39;ll keep your information on file. That is true - we will keep your information! You may be brilliant; you may be the next Einstein&hellip;but we only have so many jobs available. We wish we could provide jobs to every person who wanted to work here, but we&#39;d soon be out of business if we did.</p>
<p>
Please don&#39;t be offended by our automated response. We&#39;re choosing to spend our time on activities that will help our business grow. Once we grow, we&#39;ll be able to hire more people.</p>
<p>
Thanks for thinking of FatWallet!</p>
