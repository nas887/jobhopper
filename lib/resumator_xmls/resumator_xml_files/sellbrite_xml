<strong>About Sellbrite</strong></p>
<p>
Sellbrite simplifies selling products across all e-commerce sales channels. Our web-based application connects sellers to dozens of major e-commerce marketplaces and platforms, centralizes inventory and orders for quick and easy management, and automates many common tasks saving hours of time. A clean and intuitive UI makes Sellbrite easy to learn and use, and the cohesive feature set replaces the need to use several apps.</p>
<p>
Sellbrite was founded by two friends who, like many online retailers, became frustrated with the time and effort it took to list and sell products across multiple e-commerce marketplaces, such as Amazon and eBay. What&#39;s more, when looking for software tools to help with this problem, they could only find second-rate products that were expensive, unintuitive, incohesive, and limited to just one or a few marketplaces. So they decided to solve the problem themselves. Their solution is Sellbrite.</p>
