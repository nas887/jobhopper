2 years customer service experience required</li>

Quick learner: The site is full of features both on the consumer-facing side and back-end that require an intimate knowledge of our proprietary systems.&nbsp; We will teach you everything you need to know, but you should be ready to learn a lot in a short amount of time.</li>
<li>
