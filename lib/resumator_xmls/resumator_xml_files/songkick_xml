<p>
<strong>What we&rsquo;re looking for</strong></p>

Although Songkick is built around fans, we reach those fans through an increasing number of partners. This can be via our partnerships with Bandcamp, Foursquare, SoundCloud, Spotify, YouTube, and others.

Evangelize Songkick&rsquo;s overall mission &ndash; to get more fans to more shows by using technology to improve access to live music</li>
<li>
Build deep relationships and deliver fantastic integrations with global partners that can accelerate Songkick&rsquo;s mission. From the giant tech platforms to online music services</li>
<li>
In partnership with our development team work to make Songkick&rsquo;s API and database the central nervous system for live music data</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Natural evangelist. You&rsquo;re highly persuasive, charismatic, full of passion, energy, and quick to empathize, you can sell anything that you really believe in</li>
<li>
Ambitious, you&rsquo;ll be known as a rising star with incredible potential. You&rsquo;ll likely see business development as an exciting stepping stone on your path to a broader start-up leadership role</li>
<li>
A passion for technology and music</li>
<li>
Extremely organized. You&rsquo;re always on top of your email, and have proven experience juggling a wide-range of relationships impeccably</li>
<li>
Analytical, focused on highly scalable solutions</li>
<li>
Excited to travel a huge amount to meet partners in person and expand our global network</li>
<li>
Connected. You&rsquo;re an active participant in the communities you care about and naturally build a network of peers and mentors around you</li>
<li>
Used to achieving a lot with limited resources</li>
<li>
Start-up experience a plus</li>
<li>
2+ years experience in a business development role, ideally at a technology company</li>
</ul>

<li>
Define and analyze metrics, both to assess a feature&rsquo;s success and to articulate its opportunity.</li>
<li>
Be the voice of our beloved users and analyze their needs appropriately for the problem at hand, whether quantitatively or qualitatively.</li>
