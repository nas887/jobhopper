<p>

<p>
Backend engineers help Mixpanel keep up with the immense amount of data volume growth we get each month. They build fast, scalable, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems. Our backend engineers are ready to use existing software without reinventing the wheel, but they benchmark the hell out of it first - and if it&#39;s not good enough, they&#39;ll build something better.</p>
<p>
At some companies, scaling is a solved problem. &nbsp;At Mixpanel, you&#39;ll learn new things about distributed systems every day.</p>

The solutions team also plays an important role as mixpanel evangelists. On any given day you might find yourself in a strategic discussion with the CMO of a Fortune 500 company or just figuring out how many pizzas it takes to satisfy the 40 customers who just RSVP&#39;d for your Q&amp;A session.</p>
<p>
There are moderate technical requirements for this job. You must understand Javascript, HTML and HTTP. You also must have experience with at least one language commonly used for web apps (Python, PHP, Ruby, etc). Additionally we are looking for:<br />
<br />
- At least 3 years of work experience (any industry)<br />

- Superb writing skills<br />
- The ability to listen. Figure out the question behind the question to anticipate what the customers need even before they realize it.</p>
<p>
We pay a competitive salary, provide full benefits, and will cover relocation expenses to San Francisco.</p>
<p>
<strong>Financial Considerations:</strong><br />
Mixpanel is making millions in revenue, cash flow postive, and backed by top-tier investors including: Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Y Combinator, Max Levchin, Michael Birch, and Keith Rabois -- raising a total of $12M.</p>

2+ years of professional experience</li>
<li>

<li>
Managing interview logistics for a growing candidate pool</li>

<p>
Our idea of &quot;right&quot; might be a little unusual, though - we don&#39;t care too much about your existing experience. We think recruiting is a marketing problem, best approached in a creative and entrepreneurial way. We want someone who can figure out how to get applicants knocking down our door, not someone who just wants to spam linkedin.</p>
