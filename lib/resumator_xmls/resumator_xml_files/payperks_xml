We&rsquo;re a tight-knit team here at PayPerks.&nbsp; We all share a passion and love for our technology and it shows.&nbsp; Our platform is growing rapidly as our awesome business team continues to expand our client base.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re looking for a Platform Engineer to join our team and lead our Platform Engineering (DevOps, systems administration, etc.) efforts.</p>
<p>
<strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Maintain and continously improve&nbsp;the stability,&nbsp;security and performance of our platform and product</li>
<li>
Support our engineering team to keep them writing code at optimal efficiency</li>
<li>
Ensure that we keep our confidential user information confidential</li>
<li>
Assist in evaluating and deploying new technologies and frameworks to support upcoming PayPerks features</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<p>
You&rsquo;ve been in operations for quite some time and you know Linux extremely well. You whip up scripts to automate repetitive tasks at will.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not afraid to open up Wireshark and analyze some network traffic.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve experienced that feeling when things break and your heart pounds while rushing to get everything back online and operational.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been to the puppet show (pun intended) and you&rsquo;ve seen the strings.&nbsp; You don&#39;t sleep well unless everything is backed up and you know you can do a necessary restore (of course your restores will work, because you perform test restores on occasion as per ritual). &nbsp;If necessary, you can debug performance problems through the whole stack.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re serious about security, always put it first, and err on the cautious side when making security decisions.&nbsp; You know what PII stands for and what a platform requires when it touches it.</p>
<p>
Our ideal engineer is just as at home writing code as they are at spinning up machines. You therefore have extensive knowledge of Puppet, and you have good knowledge of a scripting language, preferably Python.&nbsp; Contributions to an open source project is a big plus.&nbsp; Continuous integration servers and push button deploys are part of your skillset and you can set these up with your eyes closed. &nbsp;Due to the nature of some of our contracts, applicants for this role must be US Citizens or Permanent Residents.</p>
<p>
<strong>Here&rsquo;s what we use:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Ubuntu on Amazon AWS (EC2, EBS, S3, RDS)</li>
<li>
Django, Python, nginx</li>
<li>
MongoDB, MySQL</li>
<li>
Puppet, Jenkins</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Perks of working at PayPerks include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Competitive salary, great health benefits, and equity</li>
<li>
Work in the center of New York City&#39;s tech startup scene</li>
<li>
Help create the PayPerks culture as a core member of our initial team</li>
<li>
Work with a fun, talented, supportive and friendly team</li>
<li>
Access to whatever tools and computing resources needed</li>
<li>
Time to contribute back to the Open Source community and/or create PayPerks open source projects</li>
<li>
Budget to attend conferences, training, and other events</li>
<li>
Company culture that values results and offers lots of flexibility</li>
<li>
Knowledge that what you&#39;re building will positively impact millions of people</li>
<li>
A ton of opportunity</li>
</ul>
<p>
