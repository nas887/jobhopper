			<description><![CDATA[<p>Scoop St. helps you discover new things to do in your city at ridiculous savings. Each day, Scoop St. offers an unbeatable deal on the best around town - starting with our hometown of New York City: restaurants, spas, events and more. By promising businesses a minimum number of customers through the power of group buying, Scoop St. secures discounts you just won't find anywhere else through a little something we call "collective commerce".<br /><br />Just don't take our word and New York's excitement about Scoop St., press from The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and New York Magazine (among others) rave about Scoop St. More importantly, we love helping locals save money and experience the best our town has to offer - from selling 1000 scoops to an exclusive "Taste of 7th Street" food festival in the East Village to prime seats at Madison Square Garden for the New York Knicks.<br /><br />To feature all these great businesses, we need highly motivated, persistent Sales Associates looking to work in a fast-paced, funded and growing startup in the heart of the Flatiron district of New York City.
