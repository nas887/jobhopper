If you&rsquo;re a crazy breakdancer who has recovered from breaking every bone in his body or a choreographer-to-the-stars with hilarious anecdotes to share, we want to feature you on our show! Our new web series will profile highly talented dancers of all backgrounds (from pop-and-locks to pirouettes) with compelling stories.

1. Your name, age, contact info &amp; dance background<br />
2. A 1-2 sentence &ldquo;pitch&rdquo; about your story<br />

This is a small commitment, one 3-4 hour shoot. You will need to be able to create a routine that fits with the music we provide you. Please note: You must be local to the Los Angeles area or able to travel here on your own for the casting call and episode filming.</p>

Do you watch America&#39;s Got Talent and think &ldquo;I could do that.&rdquo; Now, you can...but without the constraints of a stage. We&rsquo;re looking for fearless performers of all ages to put on flash mob-style shows in public places. If you&rsquo;ve never had street performance experience, that&rsquo;s ok; but be ready to make your debut. As a one-man guerilla show you&rsquo;ll pop up on busy sidewalks, near malls and everywhere else unsuspecting audiences gather. We&rsquo;re looking for exceptional talents with a compelling back story and sky-high aspirations to dominate the pavement.</p>
<p>
We want to help showcase your talents to over 100,000 people in less than a week&mdash;the world will be your stage as your performance is broadcast on a top 5 major Internet portal. Why bother with trying to pack a traditional auditorium when you could show off your talents to millions? Submit your your name, age, contact info, your background, and a link to a video of you doing your thing.</p>
<p>
This is your chance to show off your skills and maybe be the next viral hit. This is a small commitment, one 3-4 hour shoot.</p>
<p>

Recruiting stellar dance talent to be part of a web series hosted on a top 5 major internet portal (think Yahoo!, YouTube, Bing). Each video will receive over 150,000 views within the first week of release.</p>

Although this will be an unpaid opportunity...if you or your team want to be discovered and exposed to the world, this is your chance.</p>
<p>
Each person/team will only need to come in for one 3-4 hour shoot. You will also need to modify or create a routine that fits with the music that we provide for you (this can be discussed more in detail later)</p>
<p>
We are looking for all types of dance, from ballet to hip hop to belly dancing. So if you have moves, now is your chance to bust them.</p>
<p>
Any questions or interests, please submit your reel and contact information.</p>
<p>
Our studio is in Culver City, so talent must be willing to come to Los Angeles, CA to shoot.</p>

<li>

<li>
Hitting&nbsp; the streets to find some of the most entertaining/engaging/inspiring talent in Los Angeles</li>
<li>

<li>
Summarizing and presenting the best casting options to senior staff</li>
<li>
Assisting with the production of our shows. ie. Giving hosts/talent advice and critiques on how to improve their performances, working w/ 3rd party editors to ensure prompt delivery of content, facilitating internal production, etc.</li>
