	Are you the type of person who likes to use the latest technology?&nbsp; Do you enjoy seeing your work go from inception to production in a few short weeks? If so, the Grasshopper Development Team is looking for you!</p>
<p>
	If we were to draw up a wish list of qualities for Grasshopper&#39;s next great IVR engineer, they&#39;d read:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Entrepreneurial approach to problem solving by taking the initiative to find new and innovative solutions to daily challenges</li>
	<li>
		Passionate about software engineering.&nbsp; Do you take pride in your craft and ooze enthusiasm out of every pore? We do!</li>
	<li>
		Fundamental understanding of multi-threaded systems.&nbsp; Pop quiz: What is the difference between a semaphore and a mutex?</li>
	<li>
		Experience with enterprise IVR application development (Dialogic, SIP, HMP)</li>
	<li>
		Serious C# and .NET 3.5/4 skills (Think Obi Wan, as opposed to a young Luke.)</li>
	<li>
		Slightly fanatical about software quality and customer satisfaction</li>
	<li>
		A technical leading, code reviewing, pair programming, mentor type of person.&nbsp; Love what you do so much you want to share the know-how with others? Perfect.</li>
	<li>
		Proficient and capable user of your Tech-speak to Business-speak dictionary; use it wisely to help craft clear requirements and understand the business needs framing your work.</li>
	<li>
		Unit test friendly (If you&#39;ve ever corrected someone on the difference between a mock and a stub, you&#39;re our kind of people.)</li>
	<li>
		Committed to getting your features in front of customers; we need your talents from requirements discussion all the way through to deploying the code.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	That&#39;s a tall order to fill, but if you fit the description, we have some great stuff to offer: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Exciting technology.&nbsp; Want to write test-driven code in .NET 3.5 where you&#39;re mocking dependencies with Rhino Mocks?&nbsp; We already do.</li>
	<li>
		Short iterations.&nbsp; You can see actual customers using your work in just a few weeks!</li>
	<li>
		Awesome work environment.&nbsp; We&#39;ve got free snacks, free drinks, and a dedicated room for our Wii.&nbsp; Make sure not to choose Funky Kong on Mario Kart though, or feelings will get hurt.</li>
	<li>
		Tremendous benefits.&nbsp; What could you do with 4 paid weeks off?&nbsp; You get bonus points if your answer involves building a robot.</li>
	<li>
		A worthy challenge.&nbsp; Think you can implement an elegant, intuitive user interface for a feature-packed product?&nbsp; Or do enterprise-level SOA work?&nbsp; Or write telephony code that&#39;ll stand up to tens of thousands of phone calls?&nbsp; Let&#39;s see it.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Thousands of customers already use Grasshopper&#39;s virtual phone system every week.&nbsp; We&#39;re looking for an excellent IVR developer to help us implement exciting, new features across our platform.&nbsp; If you&#39;re ready to write some serious code while having fun doing so, drop us a line.</p>
<p>
	About Grasshopper:</p>
<p>
	Grasshopper is one of the fastest growing privately held companies in the U.S. (Inc. named us #66 overall in 2007). We help entrepreneurs sound professional and stay connected with Grasshopper, the Virtual Phone System for entrepreneurs.
