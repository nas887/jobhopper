ZenCash is looking for our next superstar designer!</p>
<p>
Design is in our blood here at ZenCash, so this is an opportunity for a talented designer to do their best work alongside a supportive product team that is pioneering new ground in the way financial apps look and feel. We&#39;re in the midst of designing the ultimate receivables app, an app that will help both small and large businesses improve their cashflow, save money, and reduce stress, while making businesses more honest and fair. ZenCash is saving the world (in its own way) and we need a righteous, kick-ass interaction designer to help us do it.</p>
<p>
Your day would typically involve a morning check-in with the team to get up to speed for the day, and then you&#39;d be working both independently and in small groups of 2-3 to generate new and refined concepts and prototypes. We&#39;d then take the prototypes that work and refine them into actionable stories for our engineering team to hammer out into working product in as short a time as possible. We try to be lean, iterative and accountable. We recognize that good ideas come from every part of the team and we&#39;re all in this together.</p>
<p>
This position could be remote or it could be local. We&#39;d especially love a designer based in either Romania (Cluj), Dallas, TX, or San Francisco, but we&#39;re open to new ways of working together and appreciate everyone&#39;s unique cultural contributions. Our bottom line is that you are proactive and can communicate effectively (especially in writing). And we have a scrum-oriented dev cycle, so you&#39;d need to be comfortable (if not familiar) with the discipline that that can bring to product development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We&#39;re looking for someone who:</p>
<ul>
<li>
has been designing and developing websites, preferably web applications, for 5+ years</li>
<li>
has a very strong sense of information architecture and user empathy</li>
<li>
has experience doing user research to dig up use cases you&#39;d never have thought of</li>
<li>
can demonstrate the ability to work within an established look and feel</li>
<li>
can demonstrate the ability to establish a brand new look and feel that is clearly based on a target demographic</li>
<li>
can sketch, wireframe, do gorgeous comps and, ideally, prototype your design in html/css and javascript</li>
<li>
is familiar with the latest front-end technologies, such as Haml, SCSS, and JavaScript and / or CoffeeScript, rich frameworks such as Ember.js, Backbone.js.</li>
<li>
can make javascript do helpful things with the UI</li>
</ul>
<p>
Reach out to us by email at tyler@zencash.com with a brief note about yourself and how you see B2B tools making the world a better place; a resume or LinkedIn profile should be included, as well as a link to where we can see your work online (Dribbble ideally).</p>
