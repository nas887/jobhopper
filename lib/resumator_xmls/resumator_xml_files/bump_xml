	At Bump, we are committed to delivering the highest quality product we can to our millions of users.&nbsp; We don&#39;t always release perfect products right off the bat, but we do continuously strive to make them better and better.</p>
<p>
	The Data Group is responsible for ensuring that we deliver the best experience possible to our users.&nbsp; This is achieved through a combination of making sure that our engineering systems are working correctly, and also that when a result is delivered to a user there is a quantitative explanation of why it occurred.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Act as an interface between product, engineering and technology R&amp;D/math groups to create tools for quantitatively visualizing an individual user&#39;s experience and aggregate user behavior.&nbsp; You will be responsible for the data quality of the product at the micro and the macro level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	You will know all the details of how our product should work, and collaborate with our data and engineering teams to fix any issues you uncover. &nbsp;This is perfect for someone with good Python programming skills who is also interested in data, and is interested in rapidly learning about the technologies we use in our leading-edge environment.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Proficiency in Python and basic HTML/front end programming</li>
	<li>
		Extremely high attention to detail (you are the first person to identify when something is less than perfect, and you don&#39;t rest until it&#39;s fixed)</li>
	<li>
		Previous experience in a QA or other data-driven / detail-oriented role</li>
	<li>
		Math skills (probability, stats)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Additional valuable skills:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Database knowledge (you know how to grep and write scripts that save you time)</li>
	<li>
		Experience with data visualization and dashboarding</li>
	<li>
		Great communications skills</li>
</ul>

	To our users, Bump is a magical experience.&nbsp; What they don&rsquo;t see is the math behind the scenes that detects a gesture and determines precisely which two phones bumped together in surprisingly creative ways.&nbsp; With our next wave of (still secret) products, machine learning will have an even greater impact, and employ more types of smartphone data and social network data.</p>
<p>
	At Bump you can use your machine learning expertise to directly enable new user interactions (not just serving ads or doing small marginal improvements)</p>
<br />
<p>
	<b>Responsibilities</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Own one or more domains where machine learning and classification directly impacts user experience</li>
	<li>
		Improve product performance through better data modeling and creative algorithm development</li>
	<li>
		Code prototypes, test, analyze, refine, repeat</li>
	<li>
		Use any and all tools you need, including visualization, machine learning techniques, rule based heuristics, and probabilistic modeling</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<br />
	<b>Requirements </b></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Real world data analysis:</strong>&nbsp; Probability, optimization, machine learning and algorithmic analysis</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Creative problem solving experience:</strong> You come up with multiple possible solutions, not necessarily the most linear/logical one only</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Scientific approach:</strong>&nbsp; Test and analyze experiments, then synthesize your results quickly and cohesively.&nbsp; You focus on the big picture for what you are trying to improve.&nbsp; You can get in to the weeds as needed, but you can also give a quick answer that&rsquo;s &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;</li>
	<li>
		<strong>CS fundamentals:</strong>&nbsp; Experience with C or Java, Python, Haskell (nice to have), at least one statistical analysis tool (R, MATLAB, etc)</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Classification and clustering techniques:</strong> Probabilistic inference, support vector machines, hidden Markov models, and decision trees</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Discretion:</strong>&nbsp; You will be trusted to work on our most sensitive technologies and new products, and expected not to discuss these outside of your team</li>
	<li>
		Work in our office in Mountain View, CA&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<br />
	<b>Exceptional candidates will have </b></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Enthusiasm for the mobile industry, familiarity with the app landscape and the component technologies (location, accelerometer, camera, data libraries on phone, etc)</li>
	<li>
		Multimedia signal processing or gesture recognition experience</li>
	<li>
		Social graph experience.&nbsp; Compare, combine, and segment based on a variety of inputs and behaviors</li>
	<li>
		2+ years of experience at a product-driven and metrics-driven start-up</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<br />
	<b>To Apply</b><br />
	Please submit your resume, cover letter, and include links to relevant projects or code samples.&nbsp; Feel free to distinguish your application however you choose. &nbsp;Unique projects (not just work or academic assignments) often catch our eye.<br />
