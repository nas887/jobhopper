The financial crisis is completely changing how banks do business, but one of the most important changes is how they will manage customer assets. The collapse of Lehman Brothers and, more recently, MF Global clearly showed that clients cannot assume their collateral will be safe &ndash; and regulators are now trying to address this.</p>
<p>
Custody Risk looks closely at new financial market regulations and talks to the people making the decisions, ensuring our coverage is essential reading for the custody and clearing industries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We are now looking for a Staff Writer for Custody Risk and its sister brand, ETF Risk, which focuses on the burgeoning exchange-traded funds market. The successful candidate will be responsible for generating print and digital content for the Custody Risk and ETF Risk brands. The Staff Writer will be required to write his or her own content and break news online, have involvement in editorial surveys and polls, and liaise with the events team on developing awards and conferences where necessary.</p>

Over the last twelve months ITHound.com has seen impressive growth in revenue from international lead generation which now accounts for a massive 30% of total revenue.</p>
<p>
The demand and success of our international business has led to significant investment from Incisive Media to push the offering forward &ndash; investment that will grow for several years</p>
<p>
This is where you come in.</p>
<p>
I am very pleased to offer this once in a lifetime opportunity of leading IThound&rsquo;s charge into the US.<br />
http://www.ithound.com is an industry-leading business research library providing information for technology and business professionals.</p>
<p>
IThound.com is the largest free library of IT resources in the UK containing white papers, analyst reports, case studies, product specs and web seminars.</p>
<p>
Our market is a competitive one but also rewarding. Lead-generation is one of the US&rsquo;s fastest growing areas.<br />
You will be selling IThound to budget holders within technology companies and agencies in the US and you will be pivotal in driving our offering forward.</p>
<p>
Make no mistake - it&#39;s going to be tough, but it&rsquo;s also going to be fun. This is a role where a hungry, career minded professional is going to make a name for themselves.</p>

<p>
We are looking for someone with at least two years&rsquo; experience, preferably with knowledge of lead generation, but sales capability comes first, second, and third.</p>
<p>
As the Global Account Manager, you&#39;ll be developing and managing revenue &amp; relationships with direct clients and agencies in the technology industry. You need to be a focused, proactive self-starter, and able to multi-task in a fast-paced environment.</p>
<p>
You&#39;ll use your analytical skills to develop and close new business, grow existing business, and support your team with research, client insights, market analysis and other collateral. Above all, you&#39;ll be responsible for hitting IThound US&rsquo;s revenue targets.</p>

The financial crisis is changing the way banks and markets work &ndash; often in ways that escape wide attention, sometimes in ways no-one expected. Risk covers these events earlier &ndash; and in more depth &ndash; than anyone else. We&#39;re closer to the policy-makers who are rewriting the rules, and to the companies that will be affected by them.</p>
<p>
We are now looking for a staff writer to join the team in London. The successful candidate will be expected to develop senior level contacts and dig up exclusive news stories for both online and print, as well as write in-depth features. The job involves international travel &ndash; our journalists interview top-level bankers and regulators all over the world. We also want to give our staff writers the opportunity to take responsibility for special reports and supplements, and to get experience with new forms of rich media, such as video.</p>

Legal Week has a vacancy for a news editor to lead this flagship title&rsquo;s reporting team.</p>
<p>
This is a rare opportunity for an ambitious and experienced journalist to take a leading editorial role within Legal Week.</p>
<p>
Managing a team of four reporters in London and working closely with Legal Week&rsquo;s Asia editor, the news editor will be responsible for overseeing all of Legal Week&rsquo;s news output in print and online. The successful candidate will be able to demonstrate a deep understanding of how off-diary news is generated combined with the ability to impart this knowledge to a busy reporting team, thereby ensuring a steady flow of exclusive stories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The news editor will work very closely with the editor, including on the recruitment, assessment and development of staff, and with the deputy editor, especially on the commissioning of analysis pieces and interviews from the reporting team.

<p>
Key responsibilities will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Ensure the smooth running of Legal Week&rsquo;s news output</li>

Ensure very high levels of accuracy and be aware of potential legal risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We are looking for an experienced business journalist with the drive, ambition and flair to make a success of this vital and demanding role. Knowledge of the legal business market would be a distinct advantage, but is not essential. However, the successful candidate must have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Substantial editorial and management experience, including as a business reporter</li>
<li>
Experience of juggling a variety of roles, and the ability to adapt at short notice</li>
<li>
The confidence to represent the brand externally when required</li>
<li>
An excellent work ethic, a commitment to high standards, good accuracy and professional integrity.</li>
