Exciting opportunity for an enthusiastic graduate developer to join an award-winning VC-backed start-up during its rapid growth phase.<br />
Skimlinks has been highlighted as an &#39;emerging leader&#39; by Saul Klein from Index Ventures, described by Techcrunch as one of London&rsquo;s leading startups, and voted in the top 10 of the Guardian Tech Media Invest.</p>
<p>
<strong>About the role</strong></p>
<p>
Skimlinks is a technology company. We have launched a range of unique, compelling products that have shaken up the online monetization space. We use some pretty cutting-edge technologies to handle over 1 billion pageviews/month, which also makes our data projects very interesting.&nbsp;We are looking for a graduate software developer with a start-up attitude to help build our product vision.</p>
<p>
This exciting role will require someone who cleverly possesses the following skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="font-size: 12px;">Experience of building web applications using LAMP architecture. This will require excellent knowledge of PHP5 &amp; OOP and MySQL5 and its surrounding technologies</span></li>
<li>
Broad interest and experience in other programming languages including Python</li>
<li>
Code XHTML and CSS to W3C standards, WAG accessibility, cross-platform compatibility and semantic coding would be highly regarded</li>
<li>
Javascript and JQuery</li>
<li>
API experience, including integration and API design would be very impressive (we are a bit fanatical about APIs)</li>
<li>
Experience of Mongo, Hadoop and HBase is advantageous. We love big data.</li>
<li>
Experience developing scalable web applications for high-volume sites is highly desirable</li>
<li>
Passion for Open Source technologies, active participation in the Open Source Community is very telling (in a positive way).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The role is based in Shoreditch, London right in the middle of Silicon Roundabout. Our digs have a strong technology culture, lots of space and a high-spec setup.<br />
<br />
<strong>About you</strong></p>
<p>
Here at Skimlinks we value dedication, enthusiasm, and a love of innovation. We are disrupting the online monetization industry, and welcome candidates who want to be a part of this ambitious journey. But its not just hard work, we definitely appreciate a bit of quirkiness and fun along the way.</p>
<ul>
<li>
You fit the bill of an experienced, innovative developer, with deep interest in Internet Technologies and a passion for building ground-breaking online tools. You are motivated, solutions driven, and eager to face the challenges that a startup requires.</li>
<li>
You like fixing problems but that&#39;s not enough. You&#39;re obsessed with knowing why it broke and committed to stop it happening in the future.</li>
<li>
You strive to push projects to the next level and give that special touch of quality, attentiveness and excellence.</li>
<li>
You are able to give accurate estimations of development times for projects, and organise your time to meet project deliverables and deadlines. You thrive in fast-paced environment that iterates quickly.</li>
<li>
You&#39;re interested in the challenges facing online publishers, and have an appreciation of the culture of content creation and blogging.</li>
<li>
You will love to code, think of it as recreation rather than work, and have a number of your own projects you have done just for fun.</li>
<li>
You will know the cURL library inside out and you will think a table with a million rows is rather puny.</li>
<li>
You love being part of a team.&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<span style="font-size: 12px;">You have a sense of humour, are ambitious, and love the thrill and madness of working in a start-up environment.</span></li>

Skimlinks is looking for a programmer (we&#39;re language agnostic) who&#39;s interested in joining and leading our front-end team.</p>
<p>
<strong>What will I be working on?</strong><br />
We&#39;re building a single page analytics suite to give web publishers actionable information on how they are monetizing and how they can better monetize (hey you&rsquo;re helping keep the Internet&rsquo;s lights on) . Its powered with Backbone.js, require.js, Highcharts and SASS. We&#39;re open minded about trying new tools and technologies (any ClosureScript fans out there?). It&#39;s very Javascript focussed, built around our API, and we&#39;re out to make a fast, reliable (testing + CI) web app that feels of the web, rather than a Flash RIA circa 2003.</p>
<p>
While it&#39;s obviously simplest for someone who knows Javascript already, if you&#39;ve never seen a === (some equality operators require more equality than others ;) ) but love picking up new technologies we&#39;d like to hear from you.</p>
<p>
<strong>What it&rsquo;s like to work @Skimlinks?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Big screens and fast computers (Linux, OSX or PC, up to you)</li>
<li>
Sociable company - Friday drinks and regular team lunches</li>
<li>
Office right on Old Street roundabout - more hipster coffeeshops that you could possibly need</li>
<li>
Unix platform on AWS</li>
<li>
Standups and a lightweight process</li>
<li>
Testing and Jenkins CI</li>
<li>
QA team - ever had someone on your team to whose job it is to double check your end product and catch any errors before release? It&#39;s good.</li>
<li>
A product team that understands why you might want to spend a sprint refactoring</li>
<li>
Hackdays, big data access on what millions of people are clicking on and buying</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p>
We&#39;ll be most interested in reading your code, regardless of experience. If you&#39;ve not got some code we can read, either bash out that project you&#39;ve been meaning to work on or ask us and we&#39;ll put together a quick project for you (it&#39;ll be something fun, maybe involving d3.js) which will take an hour or so.</p>
<p>
If you&#39;d like to come in and have a look around and meet the team pre-interview, get in touch.</p>
<p>
We look forward to meeting you!</p>
