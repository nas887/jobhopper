PulsePoint is a digital media company headquartered in NYC that&rsquo;s looking to grow the engineering team supporting our Exchange by adding developers who are: smart, get things done, communicate well, understand computer science, take pride in engineering, and want to work in an interesting and rapidly evolving industry. We have an experienced team that is looking to add developers seeking technical challenge and empowerment to make decisions that really move the business forward.</p>
<p>
Some major projects the Exchange team is currently working on: continuing to scale our core exchange platform, honing the intelligence of our optimization, cutting feedback time for business intelligence, and aggressive automation. Currently, the PulsePoint Exchange:</p>
<ul>
<li>
handles hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, billions of times each month</li>
<li>
evaluates, selects, and optimizes ad-serving based on advanced statistics and machine-learning</li>
<li>
returns responses collected from dozens of parties in milliseconds</li>
<li>
constantly evolves to meet market demands that change in days and weeks, not months/years</li>
<li>
factors thousands of data-points in every serving decision</li>
</ul>
<p>
If working in an agile shop with a team of top-flight engineers growing the system described above sounds interesting, some things that you should know:</p>
<p>
What we look for in our senior engineers and technical leaders:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Independence and strong ownership of business problems and their technical solutions</li>
<li>
Excellent problem solving and critical thinking</li>

<li>
Experience with open source projects and tools (e.g. apache projects, maven, Spring, tomcat/glassfish)</li>
<li>
Experience with Agile, tight interaction with business and operations (DevOps)</li>
<li>

<li>
Expert Knowledge of Internet technologies/and protocols</li>
<li>

<li>

<li>
Developers who can navigate around a Linux box</li>
<li>
Passion, technical expertise, and personal accomplishment</li>
<li>
Rolling up your sleeves and getting things done</li>
</ul>
<p>
More about working as a developer at PulsePoint:</p>
<p>
We&rsquo;re small enough you can own something and have a direct impact, but big enough that you don&rsquo;t have to go it alone. We care deeply about quality and doing the right thing, but have a strong focus on business value and time to market &ndash; and believe that focusing on the first part enables the second. Developers have technical management (who are technical and write code), as well as direct access to business, product, and operations (and they have access to us). Lastly, our Sr. Engineers have lots of empowerment and freedom of action (but we don&rsquo;t water down our responsibilities or expectations)</p>
<ul>
<li>
Some tools we use: SVN, Maven, TeamCity, JIRA, Confluence, Crucible, Intellij</li>
<li>
Some practices we&rsquo;ve adopted: TDD/unit-testing, continuous integration, code-reviews, Scrum</li>
<li>
Things we&rsquo;re working on: cloud-computing, event-driven IO, self-healing systems, analytic databases</li>
<li>
We like open source: Spring, Hadoop (we run the NYC Hadoop Meetup), Glassfish, Linux, Memcache</li>
<li>
We have rules around meetings &ndash; to keep them short and useful</li>
<li>
Developers get fast boxes, with multiple monitors, and can choose Windows or Linux</li>
<li>
We keep a library of technical books (several hundred) and haven&rsquo;t had problems buying additions</li>
<li>
We have the usual coffee, tea, sodas, snacks, socials and events</li>
</ul>
<p>
We also believe that good balance outside work produces good work, so have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sane work hours (with flexible scheduling)</li>
<li>
Real salaries, real benefits</li>
<li>
Decent paid vacation (which your manager will make sure you&nbsp; actually take)</li>
</ul>
