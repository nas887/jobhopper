	Mobile Marketing Watch (MMW) is looking for a writer with knowledge of the health industry and primarily how it relates to mobile technology. Experience and understanding in health-related concepts, technology and best practices/regulation is a must.</p>
<p>
	MMW is a blog dedicated to the mobile channel that is growing at a rapid pace. We&rsquo;re in the process of focusing on mobile healthcare, or &ldquo;mHealth,&rdquo; and are increasingly covering topics such as mHealth smartphone applications, secure mobile messaging, HIPAA compliant mobile technologies and more. While we cover more basic topics such as mobile applications, SMS and otherwise, we&rsquo;re interested in finding a writer that can dive deeper into the mobile healthcare ecosystem to not only cover relevant news and announcements, but also provide opinion and insight into new-age mHealth concepts and technologies.</p>
<p>
	Do you understand the difficulties associated with HIPAA-compliant, secure mobile messaging? Are you familiar with the regulatory hurdles new companies face when innovating within the mHealth space? Do you possess an understanding of the complexities associated with healthcare IT and how it translates to mobile communication? If so, we want to talk to you.</p>
<p>
	Contact editor [at]&nbsp;mobilemarketingwatch.com with any questions and to apply. &nbsp;Please include links to any writing samples and background information on why you&#39;d be a good fit for this position.</p>
