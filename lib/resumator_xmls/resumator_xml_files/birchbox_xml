<li>
Databases: you can write basic SQL queries to find the information you need.</li>
<li>
You know enough HTML and CSS to be dangerous.</li>

<p>
Our team spans software engineering, technical operations, product, and data science. Our challenges include:</p>

<li>
The chance to build a fresh infrastructure to express better solutions to old and new problems.</li>
<li>
The opportunity to work on conceiving, designing and building a next-generation ecommerce experience.</li>
<li>
We think Espresso, Cake, Cookies, Chocolate, and Cambodian Sandwiches are food groups. Which is part of the reason why we also believe in working out in the office. Push-ups anyone?</li>
<li>
We love our work, our team, and our customers.</li>

Birchbox is hiring students graduating in 2013 to work in the following technology areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Development of customer facing features</strong> - you will bring your passion for seamless user experience and elegant back-end code to developing features that our customers use on our website every day.</li>
<li>
<strong>Data analytics and machine learning</strong> - using your knowledge of statistics and machine learning, you will work on the software APIs that personalize every aspect of the Birchbox customer experience, from what people receive in their boxes to what they see on the site and in emails.</li>
<li>
<strong>Algorithms and operations research</strong> - if you thrive on tackling complex optimization problems from design through to implementation, then you will be kept busy creatively optimizing the way we design Birchboxes and allocate them to customers.</li>
<li>
<strong>Software systems infrastructure and performance</strong> - if you are a backend hacker or software architect in the making, you will work on building scalable distributed services, profiling and benchmarking.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The things we look for most in new grads are smarts, passion, and a solid foundation.</p>
<p>
<strong>Tech @ Birchbox</strong></p>
<p>
The technology team at Birchbox is responsible for development (and maintenance) of the company&#39;s customer-facing sites (in the United States, France, the UK, and Spain), managing hosted and cloud infrastructure, and closely supporting other teams (logistics, marketing, et al.) in our 110+-person company. We work with a wide variety of open-source technologies: Debian-based servers; Chef deployments; Ruby on Rails, Java and PHP services; and Python, Perl and R scripts. The size of our team and the breadth of its responsibilities means we rely on our engineers to be self-motivated and quickly follow through on tasks without requiring close supervision. In return our engineers are given leeway to use their own initiative.</p>
<p>
Our team spans software engineering, technical operations, product, and data science. Our challenges include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
evolving our software and systems architecture to support a rapidly growing customer base across multiple countries and languages;</li>
<li>
designing and implementing the best user experience for our customers; We are striving to revolutionize online retail.</li>
<li>
using data, complex algorithms, and statistics, to personalize the Birchbox experience for our customers, both offline and online.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Why it&#39;s great to work at Birchbox</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
The uncommon chance to be at the start of something huge. We dream big. We run fast. We love a challenge.</li>
<li>
The chance to build a fresh infrastructure to express better solutions to old and new problems.</li>
<li>
The opportunity to work on conceiving, designing and building a next-generation ecommerce experience.</li>
<li>
We think Espresso, Cake, Cookies, Chocolate, and Cambodian Sandwiches are food groups. Which is part of the reason why we also believe in working out in the office. Push-ups anyone?</li>
<li>
We love our work, our team, and our customers.</li>
</ul>
