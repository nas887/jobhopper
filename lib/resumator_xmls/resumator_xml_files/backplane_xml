Backplane&#39;s product team is growing fast as we scale. We are looking for strong visual UI designers to help our product team take things to the next level.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>How you&#39;d work</strong></p>
<p>
Backplane&#39;s product team attempts to work as a seamless, &quot;no politics&quot; unit &mdash; <em>elitist designer types can check their egos at the door</em>. We&#39;re here because we love building products and would feel lost if we weren&#39;t building them. We just love what we do and love people that love to build. That probably means that we love you.</p>
<p>
As a visual UI designer, you&#39;ll work extremely closely with user interface architects, front-end engineers, and communications designers to strengthen and realize a consistent visual style across our user interface that fits our brand identity. You&#39;ll be in charge of implementing wireframes into high-fidelity, PSD prototypes that our front-end engineers can then implement, but you&#39;ll also have to work on your own interfaces from scratch, too.</p>
<br />
<p>
<strong>Sample things you&#39;d do</strong></p>
<br />
<ul>
<li>
Take wireframe concepts and build into high-fidelity PSDs</li>
<li>
Maintain our UI kit and visual user interface styles in a Backplane UI styleguide</li>
<li>
Train interns and junior designers on Backplane&#39;s visual style</li>
<li>
Design small features from scratch</li>
<li>
Communicate with front-end engineering to make sure designs conform to visual style</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>
<strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Strong visual design fundamentals; BA/BS/BFA in social sciences, HCI, graphic design, etc. preferred.</li>
<li>
Demonstrated visual skill in a strong portfolio across platforms (not just the Web.) We want to see more than just Dribbble.</li>
<li>
XHTML/CSS fluency strongly preferred</li>
<li>
Complete dominance of Photoshop and Illustrator</li>
<li>
Understanding of the web and mobile spaces &mdash; what apps do you use the most?</li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Application Process</strong></p>
<p>
If you&#39;re interested in working with us, please send a link to your portfolio and anything else you&#39;d like for us to see related to the position.</p>
