NO RECRUITERS! &nbsp; NO RECRUITERS! &nbsp;&nbsp;NO RECRUITERS! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Are they gone? &nbsp;Good.</p>
<p>
<strong>Our elite team of ASP.NET MVC programmers has more awesome software to build than time. Are you smart? Can you get stuff done? We need you.</strong></p>
<p>
<br />
# region &ldquo;sales pitch&rdquo;</p>
<p>
<br />
Why you should work at PerkSpot instead of [Google|Facebook|Groupon]:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Brand name companies have already solved many of their cool problems.</li>
<li>
Spotlite still has cool problems that need to be solved for its 3m members. People who succeed at Spotlite are people who take ownership of cool problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>
#endregion</p>
<p>
<br />
We need an awesome developer to build database layer work, business logic, and controllers for the MVC stack for our perks and discounts portal. We have hundreds of thousands of users accessing our perks platform on a monthly basis. We are looking for additional resources to help us make upgrades to our software so we can better serve our clients. Think: modular, test-driven, iterative web development.</p>
<p>
Must have&rsquo;s:<br />
<br />
C# ninja, MVC-aware, skilled database practitioner, objects are your friend. Making fun of Java developers with FactoryFactory.GetFactory() jokes should be funny to you.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t know C# but are exceptionally awesome at another strongly-typed curly brace language, let&rsquo;s talk.</p>
<p>
<strong>About us:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Our company:&nbsp;</strong>Spotlite is changing the way employees shop for their benefits. We use a combination of great technology and a consumer approach to provide awesome software to a part of the enterprise which is in desperate need of our solution.</p>
<p>
<br />
<strong>Our development team:</strong> currently 5 developers.<br />
<br />
We have a collaborative development culture: expect to show your work to your peers, teach them things and learn from them. We have Aeron chairs, big monitors, beers on Fridays, and a casual culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Our development methodology: </strong>scrum. Our team works in self organized 2-4 week sprints. We do daily standup meetings, keep a burndown chart and poker all of our product features. If you don&rsquo;t know what scrum is, watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmGMpME_phg">this</a>. It has explosions.</p>
<p>
<br />
<strong>If you worked here last two months, you would have:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp; Put our rate engine on a scalable, message-based architecture.</li>
<li>
&nbsp; Devised cache invalidation logic for our content management system (codenamed &ldquo;Condor&rdquo;).</li>
<li>
&nbsp; Come up with another cool piece of service-based application logic and picked a really cool name for it. (Birds of prey only, please.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
<strong>In the next few months you could:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;Build an interop layer between web awesomeness and the&nbsp;coal-fired mainframes our insurance partners use.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp; Are smart and get stuff done.</li>
<li>
&nbsp; Want a place where you can play a big role.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
<strong>Do not apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t like change.</li>
<li>
&nbsp; Want to hide in obscurity.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Sorry, we can&rsquo;t do any visa sponsorship. If you aren&rsquo;t legal to work onsite in Chicago we cannot help you.</p>
<p>
