Every summer we invite two or more interns to join our Edinburgh-based Engineering team for three months between June and September. Our interns are treated as full-time employees and become a core part of the engineering team. You will work alongside and be mentored by our engineers, and you&#39;ll have the opportunity to add valuable features to our product. Last summer our two interns developed our Online Payment Portal, one of the most requested FreeAgent features ever!</p>
<p>
We pay well, we have a great office in central Edinburgh (you&#39;ll be here during festival time!) and a fantastic team of people to learn from and become friends with. You can read about the experience, as blogged about by one of the Class of 2011.</p>
<p>
In order to qualify for an internship you need to meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Be a full-time student at a UK university, ideally (but not essentially) studying Computer Science or similar</li>
<li>
Be eligible to work in the UK during university vacations</li>
<li>
Be able to relocate to Edinburgh for the duration of the internship</li>
<li>
Have a huge passion for web programming</li>
<li>
Have demonstrable web programming experience, ideally in Ruby</li>
<li>
Have a huge passion and willingness to learn Ruby and the Rails framework</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
If you&rsquo;re interested, please write to us at jobs@freeagent.com with details about your university course, examples of your work and tell us why you want to join us for the summer!</p>
