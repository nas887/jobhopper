SoundFit technologies is changing the way the world listens, through custom fit earpieces. Today we are changing the economics for audiologists and audiology labs who manufacture custom fit earpieces for hearing aids, communications and music headsets and for hearing protection.</p>
<p>
Our new SugarCube(TM) ear impression scanner is 1/10th the cost of competitor&#39;s scanners. That means that scanners aren&#39;t something that only labs can justify, now every audiologist can afford a scanner. That enables us to totally change the industry work flow, replacing slow shipping and artisan processes that work on physical ear impressions with 3D scans that fly through the Internet, live in the Cloud (Earchives(TM)), and enable CAD processes that cut days out of turnaround time, cut costs by a factor of ten, increase reliability, convenience and peace of mind. This will cut capture time from 15 minutes or more to seconds, which means that a plant of 1000 people can be scanned for custom hearing protection in a day -- and even enables captures for custom bluetooth or music headsets in retail stores.</p>
<p>
Next, we anticipate offering other manufacturing capabilities to enable retailers&nbsp; and mobile communications and hearing protection&nbsp; dealers to offer consumers custom fit products manufactured on demand. Today custom fit earpieces take weeks to acquire, cost hundreds of dollars per piece to buy, and are inconvenient to be fit. Our technologies will enable convenient scanning in seconds, manufacturing on site in minutes, and will cost in tens of dollars to buy.&nbsp; So everyone can afford custom fit earpieces that are comfortable, stay in your ears securely, increase battery life, and protect your hearing from premature noise related hearing loss for a lifetime.</p>
<p>
We are seeking programmers with any of these specific skills to assist with specific skill related projects:</p>
<p>
CLIENT SIDE SOFTWARE</p>
<ul>
<li>
