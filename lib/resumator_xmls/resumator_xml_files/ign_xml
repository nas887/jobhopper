AskMen.com (www.AskMen.com), a division of Ziff Davis Inc. and the largest men&#39;s lifestyle site in the world attracting more than 15 million unique visitors every month. We&rsquo;re looking for a Web Developer to work out of our headquarters in Montreal, Canada.</p>
<p>
This truly is a rare opportunity. You will be an employee of one of the largest digital media companies in the industry, so you&rsquo;ll be competing against &ndash; and, in some instances, partnering with &ndash; some of the biggest players in the business. Big reach doesn&rsquo;t mean big bureaucracy, however. In fact, you will be encouraged to spread your influence across all our teams and help in defining our technological vision on the desktop and onto all screens: mobile, tablet, television, and whatever other platforms the future has in store.</p>
<p>
AskMen is a Canadian-based company with a global reach, and our company culture echoes this position. We&rsquo;ve established a stable footing, but we&rsquo;ve remained dynamic.&nbsp; We are proud of the business we&rsquo;ve built, but we want to give entrepreneurial spirits the opportunity to shape it for the future. In this role, your talent and experience will immediately impact millions of users, and our environment and expectations will immediately accelerate your professional growth.</p>
<p>
AskMen was founded in Montreal&rsquo;s Plateau neighbourhood and we have maintained our headquarters here. Our full operations, however, are spread across four countries: Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia. More markets are coming in the near future.</p>
<p>
Our audience is 25- to 34-year old young professionals. They are educated, web-savvy early adopters, and high consumers of content on mobile platforms. In short: the ideal demographic for experimenting cutting-edge ideas.</p>
<p>
<strong>OUR PURPOSE</strong><br />
AskMen&rsquo;s mission is to help guys &lsquo;become better men.&rsquo; This fundamental principle guides all of our content, and it also steers how we work and what we focus on. We are in a perpetual state of improvement. One of your mandates in this role will be to develop the technological vision and tools to enable our content-makers to tell their stories.<br />
We have a young and vibrant staff. We work hard and play hard. We celebrate our successes but we don&#39;t accept complacency. We are a large media company that thinks like a start-up.</p>
<p>
<strong>KEY RESPONSIBILITES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Help reinvent how content is consumed online, and on all screens</li>
<li>
Creating front and back-end PHP components</li>
<li>
Helping to plan and implement infrastructure overhaul</li>
<li>
Participating in cutting-edge site features</li>
<li>
Help maintain proprietary CMS</li>
<li>
Drive innovation, thought leadership on where the web is going</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>QUALIFICATIONS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Essential: 3+ years PHP programming</li>
<li>
Essential: 3+ years HTML/CSS/Javascript/XML</li>
<li>
Essential - Knowledge of database-driven backends (SQL)</li>
<li>
Important - Able to work independently on projects and contribute new ideas</li>
<li>
Important - Ability to manage multiple projects</li>
<li>
Important - Experience with Social networking APIs (Facebook, Twitter)</li>
<li>
Asset - Experience with a PHP MVC based framework (CakePHP)</li>
<li>
Asset - Strong written and verbal communication skills, and an ability to translate technical jargon for non-technical executives</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
<strong>DESIRED TRAITS</strong><br />
We believe that cultural fits are more important than skill fits. We want a Web Developer who seeks to grow personally, that believes in our purpose and our goals, and has the drive to make an impact while still having fun. Other desired traits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Curiosity&nbsp; and openness to learn</li>
<li>
The instinct to stay on top of industry trends</li>
<li>
The ability to inspire and change minds with new ideas, visions</li>
<li>
The capacity to encourage counter-intuitive opinions and ideas, and be able to execute them</li>
</ul>
