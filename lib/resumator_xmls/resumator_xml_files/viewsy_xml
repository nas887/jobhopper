	Who are we: We are a <strong>*location analytics startup* </strong>doing cool things with sensors and digitising the physical world.</p>
<p>
	What&#39;s the latest news: We just won entry into <strong>*Startup Bootcamp Amsterdam*</strong>! This means we will be going into the accelerator program, working and playing hard for 3 months and then will be pitching at the end to a room full of 500 investors on demo day! It would look a little like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvbMJyo35zU</p>
<p>
	What&#39;s the opportunity: We have 1 open position for either a<strong> *lead backend or lead front end developer*</strong>. We are sitting on a php/codeigniter stack currently but are migrating over to ruby/rails. For the sake of building at speed you will have a good grounding in either of those two languages - either php or ruby, as well as github.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	What&#39;s the plan: How about a <strong>*free trip to Amsterdam*! </strong>&nbsp;We&#39;d like you to be able to join us in Amsterdam for 3 months starting the first week of April. We offer <strong>*free accommodation*</strong> whilst you&#39;re there too. We will be working alongside the <strong>*other 9 winning teams* </strong>taking part so it will be very sociable and damn good fun too. After the 3 months are up, we&#39;ll relocate back to London where we will continue on our mission to digitise the real world.</p>
<p>
	What&#39;s on offer: The opportunity to work with a hot startup at one of the most exciting times of its life and a genuine chance to work on solving a really big problem for the world - customers are biting our hands off already asking for our solution. You will be paid a salary - it wont be the highest salary money wise to be honest, but we will make up for it in the amazing environment we have to work in, plus a great equity package too.</p>
<p>
