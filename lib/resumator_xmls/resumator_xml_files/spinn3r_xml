	We have some failed Mac hardware that we would like help fixing and also prepare for selling (running backups, etc).</p>
<p>
	- 2-3 mac laptops that need to be backed up and erased and then sold.</p>
<p>
	- A broken 30&quot; LCD that MAY be the power supply (if you have a test power supply that we can use that would help immensely).</p>
<p>
	- Reconfigure a printer for use with a new access point</p>
<p>
	- Send a Macbook Air back to Apple for repair.</p>
<p>
	You should have experience configuring hardware, maintaining networks, etc.</p>
<p>
	A resume and experience should be included in your response.</p>
