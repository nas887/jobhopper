<strong>About Us</strong><br />
We are democratizing commerce for businesses. At a time when the world needs small businesses to stimulate the economy, we strive to be the company that helps businesses designing, making and selling products succeed. You know someone out there selling products; we know you do. Wouldn&#39;t it be amazing to help them make more money, hire another person, or chase their dream? If you&#39;re down with that, read on.</p>
<p>
<strong>Growing Stitch Labs</strong><br />
We&#39;re looking for a dedicated backend PHP engineer to join us on our mission to help product-based businesses with the not-so-fun stuff (which is way more fun than it sounds). We love beautiful design, brilliant UX/UI, and value integrity, trust, and respect.</p>
<p>
Stitch Labs is an awesome place to work. We are not interested in unnecessary hierarchy; instead we work as a collaborative team where we know what each other does and focus on getting things done. Everyone who works here has a voice and we all know our contributions make a real difference to the overall picture. Did we mention that Stitch is an awesome place to work?</p>
<p>
With great responsibility comes great reward, and we pay well for peoples&#39; commitment. We are an early stage company and you need to be willing to work on a small team (less than 15 people) and provide real impact.<br />

We&rsquo;ve more than quadrupled our growth in the last year with no signs of slowing down, we&rsquo;ll need someone to help keep that pace and keep us going! If you love having big goals, impossible challenges, and making customers incredibly happy whilst fostering your obsessive need for perfect code and user experience, this is the job for you.</p>
<p>
Along with coding, you will be responsible for working with our frontend developers on our agile and ultra-efficient team. Communicating with customers is a must to make sure we are delivering the most beautiful, intuitive application possible.</p>
