<em>We are a company obsessed with providing excellent support</em>. Our small and scrappy&nbsp;team has been working hard on educating and helping our customers, and now it&#39;s&nbsp;time to add a new <strong>Customer Champion</strong> to the tasty mix.</p>
<p>
<strong>Customer Champion</strong> is a tough job. They are the conduit between Wistia (that&#39;s us!)&nbsp;and our awesome customers. Our small team (myself, Max, and Jordan) spends most&nbsp;of the day talking to current and prospective customers, whether it&#39;s through&nbsp;support emails, phone calls, or Twitter conversations.</p>
<p>
Support at Wistia <em>isn&#39;t</em> separated out into a call center, or micromanaged.&nbsp;It&#39;s all about doing right by our customers. We also develop our product by&nbsp;listening to customer feedback: what they find valuable, what workflows they&nbsp;are having trouble with. This means support always has a voice at the table.</p>
<p>
Here are a some other things that are key to an excellent <strong>Customer Champion</strong>:</p>
<p>
<strong>Leveling Up, Constantly.</strong></p>
<p>
We love getting the type of feedback that makes us better at what we do. We&nbsp;also work on skillsets that will help us provide better support - like learning&nbsp;to write excellent front- and back-end code. We&#39;re endlessly curious, and take&nbsp;interest in every aspect of the business. We know a friendly answer is great,&nbsp;but an educated &amp; friendly answer is even better!</p>
<p>
<strong>Growth by Automation.</strong></p>
<p>
As a small team, we&#39;ve learned what parts of our message can be amplified using&nbsp;automation. By shooting video that educates new customers on using the the&nbsp;product, we made their onboarding experience easier and more consistent. We&#39;ve&nbsp;also learned some things cannot be scaled - the way we talk to customers is&nbsp;through our own voice, and not a script.</p>
<p>
<strong>Relentless, Dogged Determination.</strong></p>
<p>
We answer a lot of email. On the whole, our awesome customers make it easy. But&nbsp;even on hard days, we won&#39;t throw the towel in because we know how&nbsp;important our mission is. We grind because of how crucial support is to our&nbsp;business.</p>
<p>
<strong>You MUST:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Be ready to interact with customers, whether that is by email, phone,&nbsp;message-in-a-bottle, whatever.</li>
<li>
Be highly self-directed. We don&#39;t hold hands or provide daily direction here. Our goal is to help you find the most important things to work on, and trust you from there.</li>
<li>
Be hopelessly addicted to solving problems.</li>
<li>
Be naturally high-energy and capable of long days full of fun and hard work.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This isn&#39;t your typical heavy hours, low pay job. We expect the best, so we pay&nbsp;for the best. We also provide health and dental benefits, because it just feels&nbsp;right to take care of our team.</p>
<p>
<strong>Other benefits include (but are certainly not limited to):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
A rad office space with more natural light than you thought was possible. There are also dark, cavernous areas if you fear monitor glare.</li>
<li>
A world-class expert in bizarre alcohol infusions.</li>
<li>
A ping pong table and ample competition.</li>
<li>
Making lots of videos that usually involve crazy antics.</li>
<li>
A team of people who really care about the product and company they&#39;re building.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
Our office is in Davis Square in Somerville, MA. We&#39;re right on the Red Line, surrounded by great restaurants, bars, parks, and a 2 minute walk from the best coffee shop in Boston. Does this all sound right for you? Then we&#39;d love to hear from you!</p>

Good day!</p>
<p>
Since the early days, Wistia has had a focus on hiring the right people. We&rsquo;ve worked hard on our hiring process and are really proud of the team we&rsquo;ve assembled. Now, we&rsquo;re looking for someone to take this process to the next level.</p>
<p>
We&rsquo;re looking for a detail-oriented people person to build, run, and scale our hiring process as we grow from 20, to 40, to 1,000 people. This won&rsquo;t be as simple as writing job postings, nay. You&rsquo;ll be wrangling applicants, championing for our culture, and figuring out how to get the best people to beat a path to our door.</p>
<p>
<strong>This role is critical to the growth of our company. It&rsquo;s about finding the most talented people we possibly can, tracking them, and reeling them in. After all, we&rsquo;re only as good as our team.</strong></p>
<p>
While experience in recruiting, HR, and people operations is great, it is not a requirement to excelling in this position.</p>
<p>
You&rsquo;ll be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Mapping out our hiring strategy and managing this process across the entire organization.</li>
<li>
Forging the systems and analysis to maintain a ridiculously high quality bar.</li>
<li>
Managing our communication and onboarding practices to get people up-to-speed quickly and efficiently</li>
<li>
Working with everyone across the company to bring dreams into reality</li>
</ul>
<p>
Things that matter to us:</p>
<ul>
<li>
You are looking for work you&rsquo;ll love. We work a lot because we like it, and we like each other. It&#39;s weird.</li>
<li>
You are humble. We want superstars who don&#39;t need to tell us they are.</li>
<li>
You are thoughtful and creative.</li>
<li>
You are analytical. We are data-driven and that&#39;s important to us.</li>
<li>
You are a man and/or woman of action. Planning is great, doing is better.</li>
<li>
You love hats, as in wearing multiple. Headware is purely optional.</li>
<li>
You like hypo-allergenic labradoodles.</li>
<li>
You enjoy picking up coffee and booze for friends. Just because.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is a well-paid, full time job with all the standard corporate benefits like health and dental.</p>
<p>
<br />
Other benefits include (and may or may not be limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>
A <a href="http://home.wistia.com/medias/ertztr03r9">rad office space</a> with more natural light than you can shake a stick at.</li>
<li>
A world-class expert in <a href="http://wistia.com/blog/wistiavideofest-bens-infusatorium/">bizarre alcohol infusions</a>.</li>
<li>
A <a href="http://home.wistia.com/medias/4d86047c7f">ping pong table</a> and ample competition.</li>
<li>
Making lots of videos that usually involve<a href="http://wistia.com/blog/product-launches/"> crazy antics</a>.</li>
<li>
A <a href="http://wistia.com/blog/2012-wrap-up/">team of people</a> who care deeply about what they&#39;re doing</li>
</ul>
<p>
Our office is in Davis Square in Somerville, MA. We&#39;re right on the Red Line, surrounded by great restaurants, bars, parks, and a 2 minute walk from the best coffee shop in Boston.&nbsp; We are moving to Cambridge in October -- ask us about it!</p>
<p>
<br />
If this sounds like it might be fun, get in touch.&nbsp; This is a limited time offer :)</p>
