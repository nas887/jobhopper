Curbed Network is looking to hire a Ruby and Javascript developer.</p>
<p>
At Curbed, you&#39;ll be part of a small, nimble team that works all over the stack, and keeps bullshit to a minimum. You&#39;ll likely have the opportunity to push code into production in week one, and you&#39;ll have input into how your work is architected and designed. Our stack includes stuff like Sinatra, MongoDB, Redis, Phonegap, MySQL and Node.js, so there&#39;s always interesting tech around.</p>
<p>
At a minimum we&#39;re looking for someone who&#39;s completed a significant project using Ruby, Javascript, and a data store, but we&#39;re happy to speak with talented people at all levels of experience. It&#39;s most important that you be humble, efficient and eager to learn.</p>
<p>
<strong>Required</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Completed an interesting project using Ruby, Javascript, and a data store, whose source we can read.</li>
<li>
Command of the DOM and CSS selectors.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Desirable</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Familiarity with Git.</li>
<li>
Familiarity with Linux on the server.</li>
<li>
Experience with MongoDB or another document data store.</li>
<li>
Secretly prefers Sinatra to Rails.</li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>About Curbed Network</strong></p>
<p>
Curbed Network has published the sites Curbed, Eater and Racked, which chronicle restaurants, nightlife, shopping and real estate in more than 20 local and national markets, since 2007. We&#39;re profitable, growing rapidly, and have exciting challenges ahead of us.</p>
<p>
The tech team at Curbed is small and focused on getting things done. We don&#39;t work stupid hours and we value quality of life. You&#39;ll work on your choice of a new MacBook Pro/Air or a comparable Linux laptop. We offer health care benefits and a matched 401(k) program.</p>
<p>
This job is onsite in our downtown Manhattan office. No remote candidates, phone calls or recruiters, please.</p>
<p>
Apply below, or send an email with your plaintext or PDF resume to tech-jobs@curbed.com. A cover letter that illuminates your specific interest in and suitability for the position is helpful. Include any relevant links that tell us about your work (Github, Stack Overflow, etc).</p>

Thanks for your time.</p>
