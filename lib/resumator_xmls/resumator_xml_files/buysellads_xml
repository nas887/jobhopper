	BuySellAds, a quickly growing and bootstrapped company, is looking for a PHP Developer to focus on marketplace enhancements, and integrations.</p>
<p>
	BuySellAds has its own API and we integrate with a series of 3rd party API&rsquo;s as well, with varying levels of complexity. This role will be quite API-centric, as you&rsquo;ll be tasked with innovating on our 3rd party integrations, while also finishing work on our own API. We&rsquo;re looking for an experienced engineer to lead our existing efforts by helping us pick up some low hanging fruit, while plowing toward our crazier long term goals.</p>
<p>
	<strong>The beef of your job:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Being a young company we all focus on different tasks, you will have core focuses but be expected to maintain flexibility</li>
	<li>
		Continued improvements, upkeep, and advancement to our core marketplace</li>
	<li>
		Exploring and documenting our API so that humans can read it</li>
	<li>
		Helping connect and maintain 3rd party API integrations</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>The ideal candidate:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Has prior experience with 3rd party API integrations</li>
	<li>
		Writes clearly, and can produce quality API docs</li>
	<li>
		Doesn&rsquo;t get dragged down by doing some customer support for complex integrations</li>
	<li>
		Enjoys working with PHP and gets a kick out of the anti-PHP hipster movement</li>
	<li>
		Wants to work at one of Boston&rsquo;s fastest growing, bootstrapped, and profitable companies</li>
	<li>
		Enjoys working within a small group of highly talented folks vs. being a cog in a larger machine</li>
	<li>
		Self-starter, doer; we don&rsquo;t micro-manage</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>The benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Work with an agile and lean team (buzz words, we know, but we mean it)</li>
	<li>
		Work with a company who was awarded Inc 500 status in 2012, helping us maintain our growth</li>
	<li>
		Work remotely OR move to Boston to join us at our office, 3 blocks from South Station</li>
	<li>
		We&#39;ll set you up with your ideal work station, just let us know what you need to get the job done</li>
	<li>
		Health and dental benefits are elligible for US employees</li>
</ul>
<p>
	This is a full-time position.</p>
