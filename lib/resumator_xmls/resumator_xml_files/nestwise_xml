<strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>
NestWise will operate as a subsidiary of LPL Investment Holdings and will via a new and innovative offering, focus on fostering the creation and growth of independent financial Advisors who will provide financial and investment advice to a broad base of mass market Americans. These independent Advisors will use unique investor sourcing and educational methods and tools, coupled with platforms, clearing and other business support services provided by LPL Financial, to deliver financial education, guidance and advice to their clients.</p>
<p>
NestWise seeks to solve for several concurrent critical industry trends, namely: the current financial circumstances of the mass market and the eroding trust in traditional financial services institutions to serve them; the absence of an economically viable, community-based solution to allow Advisors and mass market investors to come together to build trusting, durable relationships and achieve meaningful results; and, the aging demographics within the Financial Advisory industry itself. NestWise will not only build a pipeline of new and experienced Advisors who are passionate about serving this market segment, but also will provide a compelling alternative and real solutions to a potential client base of 34 million US households.</p>

These independent Advisors will use unique investor sourcing and educational methods and tools, coupled with platforms, clearing and other business support services provided by LPL Financial, to deliver financial education, guidance and advice to their clients.</p>
<p>
NestWise seeks to solve for several concurrent critical industry trends, namely: the current financial circumstances of the mass market and the eroding trust in traditional financial services institutions to serve them; the absence of an economically viable, community-based solution to allow Advisors and mass market investors to come together to build trusting, durable relationships and achieve meaningful results; and, the aging demographics within the Financial Advisory industry itself. NestWise will not only build a pipeline of new and experienced Advisors who are passionate about serving this market segment, but also will provide a compelling alternative and real solutions to a potential client base of 34 million US households.<br />
