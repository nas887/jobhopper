Health care needs to change. Rather than a stale, passive experience focused on the<em> healthcare system</em>, we at Jiff believe it should be focused on the <em>healthcare consumer</em>, and that experience can be fun, rewarding, and beautiful.</p>
<p>
We&#39;re looking for a Senior Ruby On Rails developer to join our engineering team and help provide secure, robust REST services which are the foundation of our patient-focused platform.</p>
<p>
Located in downtown Palo Alto, about a block from CalTrain, Jiff presents an opportunity to work on the latest mobile and web technology, in a great location, with a group of like-minded, fun-loving, and hard working people.</p>
<p>
The type of person we are looking for is passionate about technology, and as demonstrated that passion by working on open source projects (hint: send us a link to your GitHub account for bonus points) and as contributed to the community in forums, gem creation, or code samples. Maybe you have a side project that excites you and you use to push the boundaries of your knowledge and learn new things. If this is you, you&#39;re already a fit.</p>
<p>
<strong>Requirements</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
5-10 years overall experience with Web Development, including experience with another programming language and/or Web Application Framework outside of RoR</li>
<li>
3+ years of web development experience with RoR</li>
<li>
Mid-to-upper level Rails developer</li>
<li>
Experience in developing first-class, enterprise-level Rails applications</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Things We&#39;re Looking For</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
You like to discuss the pros and cons of ActiveRecord and debate database design. You have an opinion on NoSQL and SQL databases and have thought, at least once, &quot;<em>I think we&#39;re over-normalizing</em>&quot;</li>
<li>
You understand startups and startup life, and want to embrace the opportunity, not run from it.</li>
<li>
Agile is your friend, but you&#39;re not religious about it. You&#39;d like to merge the best of Agile, TDD, and other processes to come up with a method that best fits the team culture.</li>
<li>
You believe healthcare in the US, from wellness to chronic care, needs to be improved and fixed, and you want to be part of the solution.</li>
<li>
Skilled in both areas of Ruby and Rails.</li>
<li>
You &quot;been there, done that&quot; with Rails-based web apps in other industries who realize what a hot field digital health is.</li>
</ul>
