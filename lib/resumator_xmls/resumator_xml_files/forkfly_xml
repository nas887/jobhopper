Here at ForkFly we believe that fun and productivity go hand-in-hand. Founded in Portland, OR in early 2009, ForkFly is a small, close-knit business comprised of dedicated employees who are passionate about our product and the ForkFly brand. What do we do? We help merchants and other small businesses choose, manage, and optimize their online and offline advertising options. ForkFly was one of the first mobile &quot;deal&quot; apps in the App Store, and we have since expanded to offer access to other social media and mobile-based advertising platforms. When merchants think about advertising, we want ForkFly&nbsp;to be their trusted partner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>The Position</strong></p>
<p>
The Senior Web Developer will be responsible for taking ownership of new features and/or support tickets from inception to release. Attention to detail and operating with little supervision is a must, as is strong development skills. On a day-to-day basis you will be working within the existing ForkFly Platform making it better, stronger, and tougher. A generalist at heart, you can easily work across the multifaceted ForkFly&nbsp;architecture and dive deep when it is required. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
You&#39;ll participate in strategy sessions and will have a voice in prioritizing our development queue. You&#39;ll also be tasked with helping devise a build/deploy strategy and help usher in test driven development practices. &nbsp;Position is primarily in-office but our work-from-home policy gives lots of flexibility to the developers.</p>
<p>
We offer a fun work environment in a spacious Old Town location with easy public transit access and plenty of bike parking. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Professional Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Expert PHP developer (both OOP and scripting), MySQL exp&eacute;rience, preferably with the Symfony framework.</li>
<li>
Expert proficiency in the LAMP environment</li>
<li>
Ability to troubleshoot existing PHP-based Symfony framework</li>
<li>
Skilled with MVC frameworks, especially Symfony</li>
<li>
Must be comfortable working in a team environment and have a can-do attitude.</li>
<li>
Proficiency in relational database systems (MySQL) and fluent in SQL</li>
<li>
Comfortable using Subversion/Git&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Ideal candidate will also have the following skills:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;Jquery</li>
<li>
&nbsp;MongoDb</li>
<li>
&nbsp;CSS/XHTML</li>
<li>
&nbsp;Linux System Administration</li>
<li>
&nbsp;Ant/Hudson (or similar build system)</li>
<li>
&nbsp;Mobile development (iOS, Android)</li>
</ul>
<p>
We focus more on what you have done and how you did it rather than degrees and years of experience. If you have preconceived notions of titles, you can throw those away. We often craft job descriptions around the rock-stars we hire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We are firm believers that what makes <em>great</em> product people stand out from the <em>good</em> are top-shelf communication&nbsp;skills. When applying, feel free to use the cover letter space to simply start a dialogue with us (i.e. throw out that canned cover letter).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
To work at ForkFly you must be creative, motivated, and an expert in your craft. The ability to collaborate with your team during intense situations and tight deadlines is a necessity. The ability to relax with your teammates afterwards is equally as important. We&#39;re a humble bunch that like to laugh. Happy hours and &quot;off-site&quot; meetings on Mt. Hood are standard fare at ForkFly. Care to join in the fun? We&#39;d love to hear from you.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
