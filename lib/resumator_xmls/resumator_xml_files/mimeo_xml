Mimeo.com is the innovator of online, on-demand document printing and distribution. Founded in 1998, our mission has always been simple: To delight our customers with the fastest, easiest, and most reliable way to print, manage, and distribute documents.</p>
<p>
We understand how important documents are to your business and that you might have to make last-minute changes, ship to multiple locations, or share document ordering with your entire company. Most of all, we know that your printed materials reflect you and absolutely have to be perfect in quality and delivered on time.</p>
<p>
Mimeo.com&#39;s simple online ordering process gives you complete control over how your documents are produced&mdash; which means you can be confident you&#39;ll make the right impression, every time.</p>
<p>
That&#39;s why we&#39;ve become the gold standard in document solutions for our clients. Companies like Google, Tiffany, Pfizer, Burger King, and thousands more rely on Mimeo.com for quality printing and reliable overnight delivery.</p>
<p>
Like all great companies, we are continually evolving to provide new and unique services to meet our customers&#39; needs. Mimeo Marketplace allows users to create their own branded online document catalog to control how documents are ordered and paid for. We&#39;re currently breaking new ground with MimeoConnect, a unique open-standards based API program that lets developers incorporate Mimeo&#39;s world-class print manufacturing and distribution capabilities into their own applications.</p>
<p>
We&#39;ve received numerous accolades for technology, innovation, and rapid growth, including the Red Herring 100, AlwaysOn 100, Deloitte Fast 50, and Deloitte Fast 500 awards.</p>
