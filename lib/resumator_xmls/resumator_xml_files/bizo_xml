<strong>What we need.</strong></p>
<p>
We&rsquo;re looking for flexible engineers who will be equally comfortable wrestling answers from big data and explaining those results to the business side of the company.&nbsp; We want people who can take ownership of both the questions that business asks as well as the infrastructure used to answer them.</p>
<p>
<br />
<strong>Who we are.</strong></p>
<p>
Bizo is a data driven online marketing platform that targets the business professional.&nbsp; Our platform has won the confidence of more than 400 brands, including AMEX, Mercedes Benz, Monster, Salesforce.com, Porsche, Microsoft, AT&amp;T and UPS.</p>
<p>
We believe in teamwork, communication, trust and not taking ourselves too seriously. We believe in the power of small teams. We believe in supporting personal growth and the importance of nurturing a great culture.</p>
<p>
Learn more on the development team blog, http://dev.bizo.com.</p>
<p>
<br />
<strong>The culture fit.</strong></p>
<p>
Self-driven: All of our developers are given a large amount of autonomy in how they work, who they work with, and when they work. They are given complete ownership over their projects from design through implementation, testing, deployment and production maintenance and are responsible for seeing projects through to completion.</p>
<p>
Communicative: We believe in teamwork and sharing experience : design reviews, code reviews, weekly lunch and learns.&nbsp; We also believe in &ldquo;strong opinions, weakly held,&rdquo; being humble, accepting and giving feedback.</p>
<p>
Quality-focused: The insights and recommendations we generate directly impact millions of dollars worth of revenue, so we need detail-oriented developers who can produce quality code.&nbsp; Quality code also helps our small team do more by increasing communication through readability, decreasing the cost of maintenance, and ensuring we don&rsquo;t work weekends fixing bugs.</p>
<p>
Gets stuff done!</p>
<p>
<br />
<strong>The technology fit.</strong></p>
<p>
We own zero hardware other than our laptops and operate our global infrastructure from four Amazon Web Services regions and eight data centers. Our platform processes billions of page views monthly and 100s of terabytes of data so we have lots of fun problems to tackle.</p>
<p>
(Experience in the following is helpful but not required.)</p>
<p>
Languages: Java, Scala, Ruby, Python, Bash<br />
Big data tools: Hadoop, Hive/Pig/Cascading<br />
Small data tools: Matlab, Octave, R, Excel<br />
Other stuff: AWS (virtually all services), MongoDB, Lucene/Solr, Google Data APIs, GWT, and loads of other fun stuff...</p>
<p>
<strong>Eligibility Requirements.</strong></p>
<p>
Applicants must be legally eligible to work in the United States.<br />
We are unable to work with H-1B visas at this time.</p>

<strong>The Position</strong><br />
We&rsquo;re looking for a front-end engineer to join our team here at Bizo. As part of our team you will assist our design team in making big gorgeous shiny buttons for our totally sha-weet (free!) photo sharing app...just kidding. In reality you&rsquo;ll help transform our raw business data into interactive visualizations &amp; reports that make marketers squeal with glee (if you&rsquo;ve never seen a marketer squeal with glee - you&rsquo;ve totally been missing out on life).</p>
<p>
<strong>About</strong><br />
Over the past few years Bizo has experienced phenomenal growth and we&rsquo;re now the 4th fastest growing private company in San Francisco. Simply put, Bizo helps marketers get to the right business audience, e.g. not the 14 year old kid with ADD clicking on all those Google ads - and we do it better than anybody else http://www.bizo.com/marketer/targetable_segments.</p>
<p>
Thus far Bizo has succeeded in building a world class backend-engineering team - we deal with hundreds of millions of impressions a day, excel in building fault-tolerant systems and know how to grab &ldquo;big data&rdquo; by the horns and process it into submission. Now we&rsquo;re building out our design/front-end team to help us take our data and turn it into products that helps our users do their jobs better. We want our applications to look great and be dead simple to use; help us get there.</p>
<p>
Ask anybody at Bizo, the best thing about us is the people - our culture is dedicated to hiring the smartest, funniest people you&rsquo;ll ever get to work with. Case &amp; point: our CEO&rsquo;s Halloween costume is&nbsp; a full-body bacon suit.</p>
<p>
<strong>Skills Required</strong>- Coding chops, you&rsquo;ll be expected to write fairly complex front-end (JavaScript &amp; Java) code to the point where libraries like jQuery often won&rsquo;t be sufficient, CS fundamentals: eg. working knowledge of&nbsp; common algorithms, data-structures, recursion etc are required.</p>
<p>
- HTML/CSS3</p>
<p>
- Familiarity with source control systems, SVN/git etc.</p>
<p>
- Bonus: JVM/Java experience (powers our analytics platform)</p>
<p>
- Bonus: AWS experience (all of our systems run in Amazon&rsquo;s cloud)</p>
<p>
- Double Bonus: You own this shirt http://bit.ly/UOc02f<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Still interested?</strong><br />
Send us your resume, a brief cover letter, and links to anything that tells us more about you-- Github, Dribbble, Your blog etc &amp; we&rsquo;ll get in touch.</p>
