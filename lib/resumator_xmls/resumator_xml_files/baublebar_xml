<p>
	We:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Love advocating for the customer and will do just about anything to keep our customers happy</li>
	<li>
		Are all about positive energy &ndash; but not in a &ldquo;let&rsquo;s feng shui the office&rdquo; sort of a way</li>
	<li>
		Strongly encourage growth within the company</li>
	<li>
		Believe Friday happy hour attendance should be mandatory</li>
