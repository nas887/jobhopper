			<description><![CDATA[<p>
This position is for a contractor to be a key contributor for a series of on-going projects, part-time or full-time and 100% telecommuting is okay. Pingv has an immediate opening for an experienced Drupal Front-End Developer (FED) with a proven track record demonstrating mastery of architecture, design and code at the Drupal front-end. The FED will apply user-centric design methods to create functional, elegant Drupal sites and applications for Pingv&#39;s enterprise-level clients.</p>
<p>
We are looking for that smart, self-directed person with the right mix of passion for using Drupal-focused technology to solve problems, hands-on coding, mentoring others, talking to users, and contributing back to the open source community.</p>
<p>
At Pingv, we are building a great company filled with exceptional people who challenge and respect each other. Is this you?</p>
<p>
<strong>What You&#39;ll Do</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Lead front-end development for a variety of client projects.</li>
<li>
Custom Drupal theme development, following best practices in CSS/CSS3, HTML5/xhtml, jQuery, custom JavaScript, and Drupal API usage.</li>
<li>
Develop and iterate on design prototypes.</li>
<li>
Mentor and collaborate with colleagues and staff on best-in-class usability concepts.</li>
<li>
Participate and engage with the Drupal and front-end development communities.</li>
<li>
Collaborate with Pingv team designers, developers and managers.</li>
<li>
Drupal site-building and configuration as needed.</li>
<li>
Collaborate with designer and creative director in managing UX documents, such as user profiles, user stories, process flows, wireframes and user experience specifications.</li>
<li>
Participate in project post implementation reviews and contribute to recommendation reports in order to identify successful/unsuccessful project elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>What You Need</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Drupal 6 and 7 proficiency, with enterprise-level development experience using Drupal 7. Drupal 8 familiarity; participation a plus. Three years of experience with Drupal is strongly preferred, meaning that you have more than a passing knowledge of Drupal 7. You know that, in most cases, there&#39;s a module for that. And you can find them and evaluate which of them is best suited for the client given the site&#39;s size, traffic, expected response, hardware cost, and other trade-offs.</li>
<li>
Expertise in standards-compliant, mobile-first responsive development, HTML5, jQuery, JavaScript itself, and CSS. Comfortable with Git, Drush and PHP. Firm understanding of Progressive Enhancement and Graceful Degradation. Experience with various front-end frameworks, cross-browser debugging, CSS preprocessors. Additional software expertise (e.g., HTML5 APIs, Twig, SASS, JSON, AJAX) a plus.</li>
<li>
Knowledge of accessibility (Section 508, WCAG) and usability best practices and techniques, Microdata, RDFa, WAI-ARIA, Schema.org.</li>
<li>
A demonstrable record of participation in the Drupal community (i.e., your Drupal.org ID shows a history of engagement and participation). You know your way around the Drupal.org issue queue and API documentation.</li>
<li>
Experience and comfort with Agile.</li>
<li>
Stay abreast of advances in user interface (both technical and experiential) and look for ways to appropriately integrate these advances into client websites.</li>
<li>
Bachelor&#39;s and/or post-graduate degree in Interaction Design, HCI, Information Systems, Computer Science, Software Engineering &ndash; or experience and expertise that demonstrate how that degree wasn&#39;t necessary. (Design maturity, analytical skills, problem solving ability, software engineering know-how.)</li>
<li>
Availability during North American business hours. Collaboration and communication require a degree of synchronous work, so we need some overlap. (Scrums are mid-morning EDT/EST via Skype. Asynchronous chats and ad hoc confabs occur as needed through the day.)</li>
<li>
Excellent communication skills. English is a must. Multilingual is a plus.</li>
<li>
You grok open source.</li>
</ul>
<p>
