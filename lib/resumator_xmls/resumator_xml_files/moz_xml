There are a few things in life you are probably good at, such as nautical knots, pie eating contests and World of Starcraft - but you take pride in your ability to quickly spot errors in someone&rsquo;s code. And generally, people either love you for it or hate you for it. If you are as good as we need you to be, you can spot bugs from 1 million miles away, and with the snap of your Indiana Jones whip - you have them bugs marching in unison down the drain of despair with no chance of showing their ugly faces to our customers. OK, but it paints a picture :)</p>
<p>
<strong>About the Position</strong></p>
<p>
You will be expected to invent and implement architecture for driving the automated testing of existing systems that have formerly had very limited testing. As a leader you will work with software engineers to build stubs for upstream testing, tests integrated with build tools and working with development and product teams dedicated to quality software. You will need to be confident in your ability to architect and code solutions that the group can use for years to come and tests that are clever enough to be flexible across releases.</p>
<p>
We are looking for smart C++ coders interested in creating testing frameworks around complex data problems and distributed systems who love tackling problems around scalability and performance load testing. We need you to be innovative, have an entrepreneur&rsquo;s approach and use creativity to improve our services on a daily basis. This job is much more than defining tests for existing distributed systems and API&rsquo;s, as you will also be working with the software engineers and production teams on early detection and monitoring solutions.</p>
<p>
You must be responsive, flexible and able to succeed within an open collaborative peer environment.</p>
<p>
The candidate must be an adaptable writer who learns quickly, communicates clearly, and enjoys working with engineers on complex technology in a fun, high-energy working environment. You should have an in-depth knowledge of Quality Assurance, a solid understanding of computer science principles, as well as knowledge of how to architect software for maximum longevity. The test software you will build should expose software defects in production level code, batch processing code as well as defects at the component and feature integration level.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Bachelor&#39;s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or similar technical field.</li>
<li>
5+ years of experience as a developer, QA Engineer, or SDET. Preferably with distributed, customer-facing services.</li>
<li>
5+ years experience in object oriented programming (C++ preferred). Python, Ubuntu, Linux, shell programming skills and using open source tools are a plus.</li>
<li>
Strong understanding of HTTP delivery protocols and a solid understanding of Internet networking protocols such as TCP, UDP, IP, HTTP, and SSL</li>
<li>
Experience with web/caching technologies such as nginx, squid, and varnish a bonus</li>
<li>
Proficient in testing methodologies</li>
<li>
Automation architecture development and/or maintenance experience</li>
<li>
Experience with automated test and specification frameworks (selenium, cucumber experience a plus)</li>
<li>
Comfort and familiarity with common data structures, algorithms and collections.</li>
<li>
Excellent leadership, communication, collaboration, organization, analytical and problem solving skills.</li>
<li>
Keen attention to detail and high level of commitment.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>About the company</strong></p>
<p>
Moz is a rapidly-growing, profitable technology startup.&nbsp; That said, we dream big--we aim to provide companies with the best, most advanced ways to measure and improve their organic web marketing (i.e. any traffic source you don&rsquo;t pay for - SEO, social, blogs, viral videos, etc.).</p>
<p>
We&rsquo;ve got the reputation of a big player with the energy of a small, nimble organization.&nbsp; This allows us to do very exciting things when we smell opportunity.&nbsp; We pride ourselves on developing kick-ass (and good-looking) software, indexing the web, providing a robust API that serves hundreds of millions of queries each day, and hosting the web&rsquo;s most vibrant web marketing community.</p>
<p>
In our downtown Seattle offices, mere steps from Pike Place Market, we maintain a fun, supportive, laid-back work environment.&nbsp; We pay well (salaries are on par with the big guys - Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Sauron) and we work hard (sometimes long hours are a must, but we pride ourselves on working smart, not 80-hour nightmare weeks).&nbsp; We&rsquo;re also very generous with vacation and flex time because we understand that our employees have lives, interests, and obligations outside of the office.</p>
<p>
Our core values include being transparent (you&rsquo;ll get every key metric about the business each week), having fun (pie-eating contests - check! Team ice cream trips - check! Friday afternoon Settlers of Catan parties - check!) and creating exceptional products our customers love. We strongly encourage you to read more about the company - our core values (below and here: http://moz.com/about/tagfee), our history (http://moz.com/about), what we do (http://moz.com/products) and a video about why we love Moz (http://youtu.be/_rr2XKYoc30)!</p>
<p>
<strong>Moz believes in the TAGFEE tenets. As Mozzers, we strive to exemplify these core values.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Transparency</strong> means I have nothing to hide from our customers. Good news is good news. Bad news is bad. I promise to never &lsquo;sugar-coat&rsquo; or &lsquo;oversell&rsquo; by delivering false pretenses. I want everyone at Moz to understand how our business is doing, what our product does, and how you can get the most out of it. I also want to be transparent about limitations. I believe in empowering people and building culture through shared knowledge.</li>
<li>
<strong>Authenticity</strong> means I have true self-awareness of my strengths, weaknesses, and beliefs. I represent these attributes honestly. I am the same person at work that I am outside of work - my authentic self doesn&rsquo;t hide behind a veil of professionalism or ego. I strive for humility and reject the pitfalls of pride.</li>
<li>
Being <strong>Generous</strong> means giving more than I receive. This serves not only those I give to, but myself as well.</li>
<li>
Having <strong>Fun</strong> means staying in the moment, losing my ego, and laughing with my team.</li>
<li>
<strong>Empathy</strong>. This is Moz&rsquo;s most important core value. I put myself in the shoes of others - customers, partners, and co-workers to understand their motivations, and why, especially when things are tough, they believe, act, and communicate as they do. Empathy is more than just listening and understanding - it&rsquo;s about embracing the emotions and viewpoints around me so that communication can be truly honest.</li>
<li>
Being <strong>Exceptional</strong> means delivering the unexpected, delightful, and illuminating.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Compensation</strong></p>
<p>
We&rsquo;re offering a very competitive salary for this position (based on experience) to attract exciting candidates. In addition, we also provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>
100% Paid Medical, Dental &amp; Vision benefits (50% for dependents)</li>
<li>
Generous stock options (1 year to first stake, 4 years to full vesting)</li>
<li>
PAID, paid Vacation - $3,000 per year toward vacation expenses</li>
<li>
100% match of your 401k contributions up to 3% of your gross income</li>
<li>
150% charity matching program</li>
<li>
21 days annual paid time off, 7 days of sick/safe leave and paid holidays</li>
<li>
Professional coaching</li>
<li>
Subsidized gym membership</li>
<li>
Subsidized internet access for your home</li>
<li>
Commuting benefits</li>
<li>
Fully stocked fridge, bar, cereal bar and all the turkey jerky and candy you want!<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<strong>About SEOmoz</strong></p>
<p>
Moz is a rapidly-growing, profitable technology startup.&nbsp; That said, we dream big--we aim to provide companies with the best, most advanced ways to measure and improve their organic web marketing (i.e. any traffic source you don&rsquo;t pay for - SEO, social, blogs, viral videos, etc.).</p>
<p>
We&rsquo;ve got the reputation of a big player with the energy of a small, nimble organization.&nbsp; This allows us to do very exciting things when we smell opportunity.&nbsp; We pride ourselves on developing kick-ass (and good-looking) software, indexing the web, providing a robust API that serves hundreds of millions of queries each day, and hosting the web&rsquo;s most vibrant web marketing community.</p>
<p>
In our downtown Seattle offices, mere steps from Pike Place Market, we maintain a fun, supportive, laid-back work environment.&nbsp; We pay well (salaries are on par with the big guys - Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Sauron) and we work hard (sometimes long hours are a must, but we pride ourselves on working smart, not 80-hour nightmare weeks).&nbsp; We&rsquo;re also very generous with vacation and flex time because we understand that our employees have lives, interests, and obligations outside of the office.</p>
<p>
Our core values include being transparent (you&rsquo;ll get every key metric about the business each week), having fun (pie-eating contests - check! Team ice cream trips - check! Friday afternoon Settlers of Catan parties - check!) and creating exceptional products our customers love. We strongly encourage you to read more about the company - our core values (below and here: http://moz.com/about/tagfee), our history (http://moz.com/about), what we do (http://moz.com/products) and a video about why we love Moz (http://youtu.be/_rr2XKYoc30)!</p>
<p>
<strong>Moz believes in the TAGFEE tenets. As Mozzers, we strive to exemplify these core values.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Transparency</strong> means I have nothing to hide from our customers. Good news is good news. Bad news is bad. I promise to never &lsquo;sugar-coat&rsquo; or &lsquo;oversell&rsquo; by delivering false pretenses. I want everyone at Moz to understand how our business is doing, what our product does, and how you can get the most out of it. I also want to be transparent about limitations. I believe in empowering people and building culture through shared knowledge.</li>
<li>
<strong>Authenticity</strong> means I have true self-awareness of my strengths, weaknesses, and beliefs. I represent these attributes honestly. I am the same person at work that I am outside of work - my authentic self doesn&rsquo;t hide behind a veil of professionalism or ego. I strive for humility and reject the pitfalls of pride.</li>
<li>
Being <strong>Generous</strong> means giving more than I receive. This serves not only those I give to, but myself as well.</li>
<li>
Having <strong>Fun</strong> means staying in the moment, losing my ego, and laughing with my team.</li>
<li>
<strong>Empathy</strong>. This is Moz&rsquo;s most important core value. I put myself in the shoes of others - customers, partners, and co-workers to understand their motivations, and why, especially when things are tough, they believe, act, and communicate as they do. Empathy is more than just listening and understanding - it&rsquo;s about embracing the emotions and viewpoints around me so that communication can be truly honest.</li>
<li>
Being <strong>Exceptional</strong> means delivering the unexpected, delightful, and illuminating.</li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Compensation</strong></p>
<p>
We&rsquo;re offering a very competitive salary for this position (based on experience) to attract exciting candidates. In addition, we also provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>
100% Paid Medical, Dental &amp; Vision benefits (50% for dependents)</li>
<li>
Generous stock options (1 year to first stake, 4 years to full vesting)</li>
<li>
PAID, paid Vacation - $3,000 per year toward vacation expenses</li>
<li>
100% match of your 401k contributions up to 3% of your gross income</li>
<li>
150% charity matching program</li>
<li>
21 days annual paid time off, 7 days of sick/safe leave and paid holidays</li>
<li>
Professional coaching</li>
<li>
Subsidized gym membership</li>
<li>
Subsidized internet access for your home</li>
<li>
Commuting benefits</li>
<li>
Fully stocked fridge, bar, cereal bar and all the turkey jerky and candy you want!</li>

We&#39;re looking for the next great hacker for a tight-knit, highly skilled web-app team here at Moz.</p>
<p>
<strong>About you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
You must like to ship software, and you have shipped software.</li>
<li>
You like to ship delightful and exceptional software.</li>
<li>
You&#39;ve been building web software for 5+ years, and are very good at it.</li>
<li>
You&#39;re a generalist, able to move wherever in the stack you might be needed.</li>
<li>
You love to learn new techniques, languages, and tools.</li>
<li>
You&#39;re comfortable working in a *nix environment.</li>
<li>
You have a CS degree. CS minor is also OK, but raises eyebrows.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>About the team:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
We use Node.js, Backbone.js, and CoffeeScript, with a dash of other languages and frameworks to taste.</li>
<li>
We believe simple is beautiful. We&#39;re hard-asses on code reviews. We hold the bar high and expect people to rise to the occasion.</li>
<li>
On the backend, you&lsquo;ll find Cassandra, Redis, MySQL, nsq, and any other tool that solves our problems effectively. We probably don&rsquo;t like any of them, but we know better than to re-invent the wheel.</li>
<li>
We iterate and ship fast.</li>
<li>
We expect everyone to have a good time working hard.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>What we&#39;d love to see:</strong></p>

We pride ourselves on developing kick-ass (and good-looking) software, indexing the web, providing a robust API that serves hundreds of millions of queries each day, and hosting the web&rsquo;s most vibrant web marketing community.</p>
<p>
In our downtown Seattle offices, mere steps from Pike Place Market, we maintain a fun, supportive, laid-back work environment. We pay well (salaries are on par with the big guys - Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Sauron) and we work hard (sometimes long hours are a must, but we pride ourselves on working smart, not 80-hour nightmare weeks). We&rsquo;re also very generous with vacation and flex time because we understand that our employees have lives, interests, and obligations outside of the office.</p>
<p>
Our core values include being transparent (you&rsquo;ll get every key metric about the business each week), having fun (pie-eating contests - check! Team ice cream trips - check! Friday afternoon Settlers of Catan parties - check!) and creating exceptional products our customers love. We strongly encourage you to read more about the company - our core values (below and here: http://moz.com/about/tagfee), our history (http://moz.com/about), what we do (http://moz.com/products) and a video about why we love Moz (http://youtu.be/_rr2XKYoc30)!</p>
<p>
<strong>Moz believes in the TAGFEE tenets. As Mozzers, we strive to exemplify these core values.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Transparency</strong> means I have nothing to hide from our customers. Good news is good news. Bad news is bad. I promise to never &lsquo;sugar-coat&rsquo; or &lsquo;oversell&rsquo; by delivering false pretenses. I want everyone at Moz to understand how our business is doing, what our product does, and how you can get the most out of it. I also want to be transparent about limitations. I believe in empowering people and building culture through shared knowledge.</li>
<li>
<strong>Authenticity</strong> means I have true self-awareness of my strengths, weaknesses, and beliefs. I represent these attributes honestly. I am the same person at work that I am outside of work - my authentic self doesn&rsquo;t hide behind a veil of professionalism or ego. I strive for humility and reject the pitfalls of pride.</li>
<li>
Being <strong>Generous</strong> means giving more than I receive. This serves not only those I give to, but myself as well.</li>
<li>
Having <strong>Fun</strong> means staying in the moment, losing my ego, and laughing with my team.</li>
<li>
<strong>Empathy.</strong> This is Moz&rsquo;s most important core value. I put myself in the shoes of others - customers, partners, and co-workers to understand their motivations, and why, especially when things are tough, they believe, act, and communicate as they do. Empathy is more than just listening and understanding - it&rsquo;s about embracing the emotions and viewpoints around me so that communication can be truly honest.</li>
<li>
Being <strong>Exceptional</strong> means delivering the unexpected, delightful, and illuminating.What you&#39;ll get:</li>
