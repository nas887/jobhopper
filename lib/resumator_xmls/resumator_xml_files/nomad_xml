<p>
<u><strong>Mobile Developer&rsquo;s typical day</strong></u><br />
The typical Nomad Developers day starts at the office coffee machine fine tuning your tamping skills, followed by morning development, technical investigation or meetings with key stakeholders sharing ideas, issues and opportunities.<br />
Lunch is often in house at a communal lounge area watching people hurt themselves in Japanese game shows.<br />
The rest of the day is usually dominated by joyful development in futuristic chairs and interactions with the tech, designers and accounts team to bring our next award winner to life.</p>
<p>
At the end of the day there&#39;s 5 kinds of beer in the fridge, ping pong, internal R&amp;D projects (currently Xbox Kinnect and 3D printing hacks) and DJ decks at the bar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We work the usual business hours and are rarely burning the midnight oil - work fills the space you give it.&nbsp; We give it 9am - 6pm.&nbsp; We balance work with a supportive culture, training, collaborative success and an energetic social club including the anual ski trip, camping, beach house weekenders and social days.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
