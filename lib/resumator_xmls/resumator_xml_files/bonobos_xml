<b><strong>Bonobos is opening its first San Francisco Guideshop and we are seeking Guides who can provide the best in-person shopping experience to our awesome clientele. Are you up for the challenge?</strong></b></p>
<p>
<strong>What&rsquo;s the opportunity?</strong> Bonobos is launching a Guideshop in San Francisco and we are looking for a few great Guides (our spin on a personal shopper) to work with our local customers on a full-time or part-time basis (your choice!).</p>
<p>
<strong>Hmm&hellip;sounds interesting. What&rsquo;s a Guide, exactly?</strong> A Guide is what we call a fashion-conscious, service-oriented, incentive driven, sales powerhouse. Guides bring their knowledge of our product and brand to the forefront and complete the package deal with their love for style, passion for quality and insistence on top-tier service. They fully understand and appreciate the importance of our customer&#39;s happiness and are willing to get innovative to ensure the customer has the best shopping experience possible. Our one-on-one, appointment based experience, offers customers both an alternative and complementary service to our web-driven mode. Don&#39;t think traditional retail; what we&#39;re building you haven&#39;t seen before. Check it out in more detail <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjVFzMVRi7k&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>What&rsquo;s cool about this job?</strong> Our shopping experiences come in a variety of forms and as a Bonobos Guide, you will be at the helm of in-person appointments at our newest location. Your extensive product knowledge and service mindset establishes you as a memorable ambassador for the Bonobos brand.</p>
<p>
<strong>Okay, now I&rsquo;m intrigued. Who are you looking for?</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>You&hellip;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Are self-motivated and confident in your ability to network</li>
<li>
Have sales experience or simply understand the power of generating leads</li>
<li>
Love making people happy and want to help everyone feel great</li>
<li>
Tell strangers on the street that their tag is showing</li>
<li>
Can create, present and sell ideas for fit parties to outside groups and businesses</li>
<li>
Know or want to learn as much as possible about men&#39;s fashion, fabrics, styles, fits and more</li>
<li>
Have, at some point in life, worn pants</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>We&hellip;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Value self-awareness, intellectual honesty, judgment, empathy and positive energy - often over career experience</li>
<li>
Work hard because we love what we&rsquo;re doing, but also believe in balance</li>
<li>
Highly value education and thus,&nbsp;require at&nbsp;minimum a Bachelor&#39;s degree</li>
<li>
Will back up our talk with a competitive compensation and benefits package, challenging projects, random acts of team-wide fun, awesome coworkers and the rare tribal atmosphere that also values individuality</li>
<li>
Are committed to building a unique, fun and successful shopping experience through our Guide team</li>
<li>
Are excited to hear from you</li>
</ul>

<b><strong>Bonobos opened its D.C. Guideshop and we are seeking Store Greeters who can provide a warm and memorable welcome experience to our awesome clientele. Are you up for the challenge?</strong></b></p>
<p>
<strong>What&rsquo;s the opportunity?</strong> Bonobos launched a Guideshop in D.C. and we are looking for a few engaging Store Greeters to welcome our local customers on a part-time basis.</p>
<p>
<strong>Hmm&hellip;sounds interesting. What&rsquo;s a Greeter, exactly?</strong> A Greeter is what we call a service-oriented, personable, and quick-thinking powerhouse. As a gatekeeper between the front entrance of our Guideshop and our Personal Stylists, Greeters will bring their savvy conversationalist skills and basic knowledge of our product and brand to the forefront the instant our customers walk through the door. They fully understand and appreciate the importance of our customers&#39; happiness and are excited to help ensure that our customers have the best shopping experience possible, even before meeting their personal stylists. &nbsp;Our one-on-one, appointment-based experience, offers customers both an alternative and complementary service to our web-driven mode. Don&#39;t think traditional retail. What we&#39;re building you haven&#39;t seen before. Check it out in more detail <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjVFzMVRi7k&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>What&rsquo;s cool about this job?</strong>&nbsp;You are the first person our customers see when they walk into our store and therefore, their first impression about our company and a Bonobos Guideshop. Customers want to learn about what we&#39;re building and that opportunity starts with you. Our shopping experiences come in a variety of forms and as a Store Greeter, you will be at the helm of our newest location.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Okay, now I&rsquo;m intrigued. Who are you looking for?</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>You&hellip;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Are self-motivated and confident in your ability to communicate</li>

Are seeking a part-time job opportunity</li>
<li>

<b><strong>Bonobos is seeking a creative and passionate Design Assistant to help take Bonobos bottoms and denim to the next level.</strong></b></p>
<p>
Founded on better-fitting pair of pants and the friendliest and funniest customer service around, Bonobos is one of the fastest growing men&#39;s online apparel companies ever.

You&#39;ll be sketching, creating cad designs, working on denim washes, collaborating with our tech team during fittings and communicating daily with our Production and Merchandising teams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Reporting directly to our casual bottoms and denim designer, you will have the opportunity to get your hands dirty in every step of the bottoms design process. You will play an instrumental role in preparing seasonal color palettes, requesting fabric and trim development, creating tech packs, attending fittings and editing outcomes, maintaining organized boards, notes, binders and more. We have an all-hands-on-deck mentality where the sharing of ideas (and chinese takeout) is encouraged. Are you ready to jump in?&nbsp;</p>

<li>
Have a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Fashion, Design or a related field and an unofficial degree in &quot;NYC savvy&quot;</li>

<li>
Are organized and detail-oriented with great communication skills</li>
<li>
Are great at prioritizing your workload and meeting deadlines, even when things get crazy</li>
<li>
Are excited to work with an upbeat&nbsp;[and quirky] team in a fast-paced start-up eCommerce start-up</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>We...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Value self-awareness, intellectual honesty, judgment, empathy and positive energy, often, over experience</li>
<li>
Work hard because we love what we&rsquo;re doing, but we also highly value personal downtime that does not include pants (designing them, selling them, marketing them&hellip;wearing them?)</li>
<li>
Will back up our talk with a competitive compensation and benefits package, challenging projects, random acts of team-wide fun and awesome coworkers</li>
<li>
Care deeply about the high quality of design and product we associate our label with</li>

<strong>Bonobos is looking for a detail oriented team-player to support the day-to-day activities of the Operations team.</strong></p>
<p>
Our Operations team is the hub at the center of many departmental spokes; we help hold the wheel together and move it forward. As an Operations Associate, you will be an integral player across all divisions of the company. Initially, your focus will be to help manage our inbound process, from tracking product shipping from vendors to troubleshooting exceptions in the receiving process at our warehouse. Other responsibilities might include assisting our eCommerce Operations team with product catalog updates, becoming officially White Belt certified, and supporting our Ninja team with customer service inquiries related to outbound orders and returns. You will also become a power user on a number of operations, inventory and fulfillment systems.</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s be honest, though; we&#39;re still a growing company that thinks like a start-up. If you need a rigid job description, this probably isn&#39;t the opportunity for you.</p>
<p>
This role will report into the Sr. Operations Associate and work with other lanes across the company from Accounting to Merchandising to Guideshops and Production. As part of the fastest-growing apparel brand ever launched on the internet, you will be able to get your hands dirty in a multitude of ever-evolving tasks and projects.</p>
<p>
<strong>You...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Are passionate about working with a team that believes in what they do</li>
<li>
Can count the number of dimples on a golf ball (but please don&#39;t)</li>
<li>
Will utilize the time you give us to supply quality work that will teach you plenty along the way</li>
<li>
Are excited to roll your sleeves up and get your hands dirty</li>
<li>
Are willing to complete the same task over and over while coming up with ways to improve the process</li>
<li>
Have an interest in our company whether you knew about us before this moment, or not</li>
<li>
Can jump right into the middle of a project (with direction) without feeling overwhelmed</li>
<li>
Have, at some point in life, worn pants</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>We...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Value self-awareness, intellectual honesty, judgment, empathy, and positive energy, often, over experience&nbsp;</li>
<li>
Work hard because we love what we&#39;re doing, but also believe in balance</li>
<li>
Will back up our talk with a competitive compensation and benefits package, challenging projects, random act of team-wide fun, awesome co-workers and the rare tribal atmosphere that values individuality</li>
<li>
Are voted by Crain&#39;s New York as one of the Top 50 Places to Work in NYC</li>
<li>
Are excited to hear from you</li>

<b>Bonobos is looking for an experienced HR Manager to lead our HR operations while keeping our most important customers in mind: our employees.</b></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12px;">Managing the HR operations of a rapidly expanding company like ours ain&#39;t easy, especially when it&#39;s historically been tasked among individuals with other responsibilities. So it&#39;s high time we bring on a dedicated HR pro who&#39;s solely responsible for implementing and running the systems and processes needed to help our business grow. In doing so, they&#39;ll provide our employees with the support they need to make working here the most rewarding, and frankly awesome, experience possible.</span></p>
<p>
This isn&#39;t just about systems, spreadsheets and reports (though yes, there&#39;s a bunch of that). This is about our most important asset - our people. From benefits administration to HRIS implementation and beyond, you&#39;ll be responsible for running the behind-the-scenes efforts that keep our company legally compliant and our employees fired up and engaged on a daily basis. At Bonobos, HR is about treating people with the utmost respect. It&#39;s about guiding them through good and occasionally challenging times. It&#39;s about navigating important and serious issues while not taking ourselves too seriously. It&#39;s about providing amazing people with an amazing experience so they can concentrate on their careers here, not their resumes. Sound good? Let&#39;s get down to some details...</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>You:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Will research and implement an HRIS system to maintain employment data and track changes on an on-going basis</li>
<li>
Have experience maintaining employee personnel files in compliance with applicable laws and requirements</li>
<li>
Will develop and conduct our new employee orientation program&nbsp;</li>
<li>
Have managed open enrollment and all aspects of on-going benefits administration</li>
<li>
Will ensure legal compliance by monitoring and implementing applicable Federal and NY State employment regulations and maintaining supporting documentation&nbsp;</li>
<li>
Are disturbingly detail-oriented, unusually dependable, exceptionally efficient and know that while HR is serious business, you don&#39;t have to be serious all the time (no...seriously)</li>
<li>
Are prepared to manage all administrative aspects of employee processes, including: hiring, on-boarding, promotions, terminations, exit interviews, leaves of absence, salary administration and benefits changes</li>
<li>
Will manage our employee performance evaluation process&nbsp;</li>
<li>
Are looking to join a team that is truly engaging, fulfilling, energetic, sometimes whacky and always passionate</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>We:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Don&#39;t mind carrying a case of Red Bull up 10 flights of stairs, covering the phones or steaming a couple of suits to help out a co-worker</li>
<li>
Currently use a PEO, so bonus points if you have prior experience using one</li>
<li>
Don&#39;t believe in fire drills (except literal ones - they save lives) but understand that sometimes things need to happen quickly and on short notice</li>
<li>
Are so excited to hear from you!</li>
</ul>

<b><strong>Bonobos has opened its first D.C. Guideshop and we are seeking Guides who can provide the best in-person shopping experience to our awesome clientele. Are you up for the challenge?</strong></b></p>
<p>
<strong>What&rsquo;s the opportunity?</strong> The Bonobos Guideshop in D.C. is looking for a few great Guides (our spin on a personal shopper) to work with our local customers on a full-time or part-time basis (your choice!).</p>
<p>
<strong>Hmm&hellip;sounds interesting. What&rsquo;s a Guide, exactly?</strong> A Guide is what we call a fashion-conscious, service-oriented, incentive driven, sales powerhouse. Guides bring their knowledge of our product and brand to the forefront and complete the package deal with their love for style, passion for quality and insistence on top-tier service. They fully understand and appreciate the importance of our customer&#39;s happiness and are willing to get innovative to ensure the customer has the best shopping experience possible. Our one-on-one, appointment based experience, offers customers both an alternative and complementary service to our web-driven mode. Don&#39;t think traditional retail; what we&#39;re building you haven&#39;t seen before. Check it out in more detail <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjVFzMVRi7k&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>What&rsquo;s cool about this job?</strong> Our shopping experiences come in a variety of forms and as a Bonobos Guide, you will be at the helm of in-person appointments at our newest location. Your extensive product knowledge and service mindset establishes you as a memorable ambassador for the Bonobos brand.</p>
