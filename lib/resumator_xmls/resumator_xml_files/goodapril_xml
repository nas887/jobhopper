<strong>We&rsquo;re Looking for our First, Lead Developer / CTO</strong><br />
<em>San Francisco-based startup currently participating in TechStars Boulder</em></p>
<p>
<u>About Us:</u> GoodApril is the first online tax planning solution for consumers.&nbsp; Unlike after-the-fact tax filing solutions like TurboTax, GoodApril leverages data aggregation to provide ongoing, in-year tax guidance to consumers, giving them confidence that they&#39;re only paying their fair share to Uncle Sam and aren&#39;t in for an April &quot;surprise.&quot;&nbsp; Founded by a pair of experienced FinTech entrepreneurs, GoodApril is a funded, TechStars-backed startup.</p>
<p>
<u>The Role:</u> GoodApril is looking for a Lead Developer / CTO to accelerate the development of our Ruby on Rails web application.&nbsp; You will be our first full-time engineer, and will play a critical role in expanding our technology stack and online customer experience.&nbsp; You will be responsible for both architecting and developing technology &ndash; this is a hands-on, individual contributor role with the opportunity to build out a team under you.</p>
<p>
Ideal candidates will have most of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
BS or MS in Computer Science or equivalent work experience</li>
<li>
At least 2+ years of web development experience (if you&rsquo;re an Engineer savant, more if you&rsquo;re not)</li>
<li>
A passion for building amazing consumer technology experiences, and the intuition and skills to actually do it</li>
<li>
Experience building financial technology, and a decent understanding of personal finance</li>
<li>
Language agnostic, but interested in and have experience building in Ruby on Rails and using Ruby Metaprogramming</li>
<li>
You are comfortable working in all aspects of a web application: front-end, back-end, database, performance tuning</li>
<li>
Solid understanding of the diverse web development languages and frameworks in use today: Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js etc.</li>
<li>
A desire to learn and apply new technologies when needed</li>
<li>
Javascript MVC framework experience (angularjs, backbone.js, ember.js, etc.)</li>
<li>
Ability to work in a fast-paced, high energy, and dynamic work environment</li>
<li>
Self-motivated with the ability to work individually and with a team</li>
</ul>
