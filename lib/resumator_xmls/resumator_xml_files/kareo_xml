<strong>Who is Kareo?</strong><br />
We are Kareo (www.kareo.com), a small and fast growing software company based in Irvine, less than 2 miles from the beach. Our solutions power the efforts of over 17,000 medical providers in the US with 1000 new doctors joining the Kareo user community every month. We&rsquo;re leading our industry in the shift from complex and expensive legacy software to intuitive and affordable cloud-based solutions. Kareo helps doctors optimize the clinical and business management of their practices.

<ul>
<li>
Ensure the success and retention of new customers through the on-boarding process.</li>
<li>
Build training programs for new and existing customers via self-faced video, webinars, and 1:1 training sessions.</li>

You&rsquo;ve got the t-shirt for establishing customer experience and relationship management strategies that gave life to enviable customer lifetime value within a lightning fast-growing expansion stage company</li>
<li>
Your trophy won for delivering a customer-first, results-driven, team-oriented environment doesn&rsquo;t fit on most mantles</li>
<li>
The chops to solve complex problems and an eye for even the smallest of details</li>

You&rsquo;ve got mad communication skills and when you give presentations, naps are unheard of</li>
<li>
For the last decade you&rsquo;ve been doing all of the above and racking up successes</li>

Hello candidate. Let us first introduce ourselves. We are Kareo (<a href="http://www.kareo.com/" target="_blank">www.kareo.com</a>), a small but fast growing software company based in Irvine, which is located in sunny Southern California less than 2 miles from the beach. Our cloud-based software powers thousands of small medical practices in the U.S. We&rsquo;re leading our industry in the shift from traditional software to cloud computing (a.k.a. Software-as-a-Service) and helping doctors get paid by taking today&rsquo;s complex healthcare system and making it easy. This allows doctors to spend less time worrying about their business and more time caring for patients and saving lives.</p>
<p>
In the last two years, we have doubled our customers and revenue and we&rsquo;re on track to double again this year! We were just recently selected by Forbes as one of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/companies/kareo/" target="_blank">America&rsquo;s 100 Most Promising Companies</a>, one of the few companies in all of Southern California to make this prestigious list and the only one in Orange County.

<p>
Basically, Kareo is at the center of the storm, which is at the center of Obama&rsquo;s policy agenda. Healthcare. A $2.4 trillion industry, representing 17% of the U.S. GDP. Technology is revolutionizing this industry and Kareo is positioned to carry the torch for the 500,000 physicians who practice in small medical offices and represent the backbone of the American healthcare system.</p>
<p>
We&#39;re looking for a full-stack, ninja Java engineer to join our strike team focused on the patient experience. If you&#39;re a progressive, technology driven, out-of-the-box coder than come on in! We&#39;ve got a beer with your name on it.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; * Have a passion for web technology that borders on fanaticism, i.e. you dream in UTF-8.<br />

<p>
<strong><u>An extra dose of &ldquo;awesome&rdquo; if you have</u></strong></p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * A GitHub account or personal engineering blog.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Demonstrated ability to learn and adapt to new technologies. You watch/forked lots of GitHub projects.</p>
