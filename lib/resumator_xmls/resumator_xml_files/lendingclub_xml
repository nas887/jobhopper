Lending Club is looking to hire a Front-End Developer to be a part of the Engineering team.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Primary Responsibilities:</p>
<p>
Participate in building Scrum process and agile culture in the company.<br />
Design, implement, and document new software components. Improve existing software.<br />
Work with Product Management to understand requirements and contribute to release planning.<br />
Research new technologies and prototype new ideas.<br />
Ensure high testability and quality of the delivered software. Work with QA and Operations to troubleshoot and fix defects in the software.<br />
Requirements</p>
<p>
3-7 years of experience in building software using Java technologies.<br />
Solid experience with the following technologies:<br />
Web MVC frameworks - Struts, Spring MVC, or other Java-based framework.<br />
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Experience with YUI JavaScript library is a plus.<br />
SQL skills to access a database from a web application.<br />
Desire to work in collaborative and fast paced agile environment.<br />
Experience in using Scrum process is a big plus.<br />
Must be self-directed, able to work independently, as well as work in a team-oriented and fast paced environment<br />
Your Passion:<br />
Modern Web Frameworks: You understand why these matter, how they help, and what they don&rsquo;t do. You don&#39;t just know what MVC stands for, but you can tell us why it makes sense. You&rsquo;ve built sites using one ormore of Express, Rails, Django, ASP.NET MVC, Grails, or AppEngine and you&rsquo;ve read through the documentation on some of the others. You choose between these platforms based on their merits and not based solely on your familiarity.</p>
<p>
Service Integration: Stitching RESTful services that speak JSON to XML spewing SOAP endpoints with a few custom binary protocols thrown in both sounds painful to you and you can explain, in an objective way, why that sort of an architecture might not be a great idea. That&rsquo;s not what we do - usually - but when we do you can handle it.</p>
<p>
HTML and CSS: Layout and styling must be second nature. While you&rsquo;ll usually be working from a wireframe or a full visual mockup, not having them won&rsquo;t cause you to produce an ugly result. You&rsquo;re a software engineer not a visual designer, but you can tell the difference between good design and bad design. That we target a range of browsers across both mobile and desktop platforms is pretty much a given. You&rsquo;re a troubleshooter. When something is wrong you don&rsquo;t sit on your hands, you jump i, to solve it. Team Player: You&rsquo;ll own your own work, but al, of us edit each other&rsquo;s code. When your team,ate does something differently than the way you would have, you see potential for you to learn. You&rsquo;re willing to share your knowledge and mentor others.</p>
