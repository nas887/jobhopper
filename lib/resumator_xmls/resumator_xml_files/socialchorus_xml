<b>The short version:</b></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12px;">Hi! We&#39;re hiring a Ruby Engineer here at SocialChorus</span><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;to work onsite at our office in </span><a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=703+Market+St+%23470,+San+Francisco,+CA&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=37.7577,-122.4376&amp;sspn=0.188375,0.417824&amp;oq=703&amp;hnear=703+Market+St+%23470,+San+Francisco,+California+94103&amp;t=m&amp;z=16" style="font-size: 12px;" target="_blank">San Francisco, CA</a><span style="font-size: 12px;">. This is a full time, regular position. &nbsp;We offer a market rate salary and the following: stock options, medical &amp; dental (we pay 100% of premiums), 401k. We actively promote diversity and encourage all qualified candidates to apply.</span></p>
<p>
<b style="font-size: 12px;">The company:</b></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12px;">How cool would if a blogger with thousands of subscribers raved about your product or service in a blog post? Pretty sweet! Now imagine getting mentioned in 1,000 blogs, each with thousands of subscribers. (Pretty sweet!)^1000 is what we do here at SocialChorus.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12px;">SocialChorus is a cloud platform is for generating word of mouth advertising via social media. Got a cool product that needs more buzz? SocialChorus. While your competitors w/ boring products try to outspend each other on TV, Google, and newspaper ads (they still print newspapers?!), you&#39;re efficiently connecting with your customers where they spend time online: blogs, Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12px;">It&#39;s a great time to join SocialChorus. Our sales are skyrocketing; leading companies with a mandate to generate revenue via social media are paying us to solve that problem. We&#39;re far enough along to be a real company and early enough to be interesting (post Series-A, pre-Series B). There&#39;s plenty of cash in the bank, we can ask for more when we need it, and we have a predictable growth plan.</span></p>
<p>
<b style="font-size: 12px;">The team:</b></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12px;">As of today, there are 7 engineers on the team (3 women, 4 men) led by </span><a href="www.linkedin.com/pub/kane-baccigalupi/7/29b/916" style="font-size: 12px;" target="_blank">Kane</a><span style="font-size: 12px;">, our CTO. We enjoy working in an Agile way; we do quite a bit of pair programming, test driven development, and refactoring. There&#39;s also a nice balance between the how much we produce, the quality of our work, the fun we have as a team, and our ability to have lives outside of the office!</span></p>
<p>
<b style="font-size: 12px;">The role:</b></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12px;">We need an Ruby Engineer with decent chops in JavaScript. While we do use Rails, we prefer pure Ruby when it&#39;s an option. Lately we&#39;ve been using Backbone.js and Node.js where it makes sense.</span></p>
<p>
<b style="font-size: 12px;">Stuff you&#39;ll be working on:</b></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12px;">Building standalone web services as we grow. For example, a few months ago we needed to add functionality for our influencer app. We broke off a piece of code from our gnarled legacy Rails app and turned it into a shiny new Backbone.js app with great test coverage. We&#39;re quite proud of how well we&#39;ve been able to increase our velocity while doing some heavy refactoring.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12px;">We&#39;re currently building a REST API from the ground up. Our customers are quite excited about being able to transition from daily data dumps via spreadsheets to accessing their information on the fly and analyzing it in real time. This will be a fun project for people who enjoy how big data is used.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12px;">Exploring new technology options is a normal part of life here; we like using the best tool for the job. We&#39;re currently building an app in Node.js, our API is being written in a Ruby DSL called Grape, and anything else that makes sense is fair game. This includes traveling to your favorite tech conferences on our dime!</span></p>
<p>
<b style="font-size: 12px;">Almost done:</b></p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12px;">If you&#39;ve got questions and/or corny jokes, send us an </span><a href="mailto:michael.pope@socialchorus.com" rel="noreferrer" style="font-size: 12px;" target="_blank" title="[GMCP] Compose a new mail to email">email</a><span style="font-size: 12px;">!

<strong>The Industry:</strong></p>
<p>
Word-of-mouth marketing is the new advertising. &nbsp;Except rather than relying on Mad Men like ad execs, our customers believe that the best form of advertising is happy customers telling good stories about great products. &nbsp;That&#39;s what we call a social endorsement and it&#39;s far more likely to influence people than a fancy superbowl ad.</p>
<p>
<b>The company:</b></p>
<p>
SocialChorus is the leading social word-of-mouth marketing solution for the brands that people love. Our customers use our platform to inspire social advocates and deliver millions of trusted social endorsements across all social channels. &nbsp;Our platform does by combining the power of word-of-mouth with the scale and efficiency of the cloud, to deliver social ROI for our customers.</p>
<p>
We build and deliver everything with our amazing development and solution teams in San Francisco. We&#39;re far enough along to be a real company and early enough to be interesting (post Series-A, pre-Series B funding). We are backed by Kohlberg Ventures and relied on by brands like 3M, Intel, HTC and many others.</p>
<p>
<b>The position:</b></p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/gal-josefsberg/0/730/728" target="_blank">Gal Josefsberg</a>, our VP Products, is looking for a social media superstar w/ a strong interest in product management. Ideally we&#39;d find someone w/ 1-3 years as a product manager, but depth in social media is our primary need.</p>
<p>
We need someone who&#39;s built, worked with or managed a social site or application so when we ask you questions like &quot;what type of leaderboard should we build?&quot;, &quot;what calls to action work best in social?&quot; or &quot;do images or text work better in social?&quot; you should already know the answer rather than have to research it. &nbsp; That means folks who&#39;ve run social media marketing, program managers who ran advocacy campaigns in an agency or product managers who&#39;ve worked on a social product.</p>
<p>
<b>Projects ready and waiting for you:</b></p>
<p>
<u>Dashboard</u>: We collect an enormous amount of data and we&#39;re looking for better ways in which we can show this data to our customers and their influencers. You&#39;ll work with customer reps and our internal program managers to figure out what works and what doesn&#39;t. You&#39;ll also work with parter programs for most of the major social networks on how to get this information and what it means.</p>
<p>
<u>Gamification</u>: Our brand customers have loyal fans who are willing to act on their behalf, that&#39;s the whole point of Word-Of-Mouth marketing. How do we make these actions fun for them so they&#39;ll do even more? Should we implement badges? Point accumulation? Leaderboards? You&#39;ll survey actual fans and influencers to see what motivates them plus do extensive market research on gamification to see which models are best suited for our needs.</p>
<p>
<u>Facebook Open Graph Data</u>: There&#39;s a lot of data in Facebook, almost too much. Which data points are valuable? Which ones should we collect? How do we get the right data while also being sensitive to the privacy needs of our customers and influencers? This is your chance to become a thoughtleader in an exciting and new space that&#39;s going to be extremely important in the future.</p>
<p>
<b>The details:</b></p>
<p>
This is a full-time, salaried position offering stock options, paid vacation, and benefits: medical, dental, 401k.

<strong>About SocialChorus:</strong><br />
How cool would it be if a blogger with thousands of subscribers raved about your product or service in a blog post? Pretty sweet! Now imagine getting mentioned in 1,000 blogs, each with thousands of subscribers. (Pretty sweet!)^1000 is what we do here at SocialChorus.</p>
<p>
SocialChorus is a cloud platform is for generating word of mouth advertising via social media. Got a cool product that needs more buzz? SocialChorus. While your competitors with boring products try to outspend each other on TV, Google, and newspaper ads (they still print newspapers?!), you&#39;re efficiently connecting with your customers where they spend time online: blogs, Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a great time to join SocialChorus. Our sales are skyrocketing; leading companies with a mandate to generate revenue via social media are paying us to solve that problem. We&#39;re far enough along to be a real company and early enough to be interesting (post Series-A, pre-Series B). There&#39;s plenty of cash in the bank, we can ask for more when we need it, and we have a predictable growth plan.</p>
<p>
<strong>The Team:</strong><br />
As of today, there are seven engineers on the team (three women &amp; four men) led by Kane, our CTO. We enjoy working in an Agile environment; we do quite a bit of pair programming, test driven development and refactoring. There&#39;s also a nice balance between how much we produce, the quality of our work, the fun we have as a team, and our ability to have lives outside of the office!</p>
<p>
<strong>The Position:</strong><br />
This position is about optimizing the app for change. Moving from a Megarails app to a service-oriented architecture. You&#39;ll help us tackle A-synchronicity issues, and help with refactoring and adding new features. We&#39;re currently refactoring and doing pure object-oriented coding, and getting away from the edges of Rails and doing a smaller, more modular architecture. We&#39;re not looking for banging together a quick prototype so much as someone who wants to do things the best way - we&#39;re a lot less interested in rock stars than steady climbers!</p>
<p>
We pair 100% of time, so while you&#39;ll have to work regular business hours, you won&#39;t have to work outside of regular business hours. :)</p>
<p>
<strong>Our Ideal Candidate Has:</strong><br />
* At least 1 professional project with Ruby. Not RoR per se, but Ruby. More of course is better!<br />
* 3+ years of experience doing OO software engineering.</p>
<p>
<strong>Bonus Points For:</strong><br />
* A history of refactoring or fixing legacy code.<br />
* Being a Polyglot! - someone who likes to use the best tool or language for a job.<br />
* Having stayed with a startup long enough to see refactoring take place.<br />
* Did we mention refactoring? The more experience and enthusiasm for refactoring, the better!</p>
<p>
<strong>Almost Done:</strong><br />
This is a full-time, salaried position offering stock options, paid vacation, and benefits: medical, dental and 401k. You&#39;ll be working onsite at our office in San Francisco, CA. We actively promote diversity and encourage all qualified candidates to apply. If you want tell us a corny joke, please include it in the blurb when you apply!</p>
