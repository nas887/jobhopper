	<strong>The job and you</strong></p>
<p>
	You are a design guru, an aesthete, a perfectionist and have the portfolio to prove it. You can&#39;t get by on photoshop express and wonder how people do. You have a Pantone chart on your bedside table and have been colour calibrating your computer since the age of 8.<br />
	You eat CSS for breakfast and whilst others stay awake at night fearing the next Firefox stealth update, you rest easy knowing that there is nothing they could do to break your beautiful code.</p>
<p>
	You might not have started in web apps or even be working in them now but this doesn&#39;t matter to you - you&#39;ve conquered every medium from print to video and back again and will do it again. Your designs are beautiful and show a deep understanding of the way people think and interact with your creations. You look at our logo and think &#39;lazy&#39; and you&#39;d be right. That&#39;s why we need you.</p>
<p>
	Your role will be to make us beautiful. From web apps to mobile, websites to posters, headed paper to mail outs. Everything is in your domain. You will be working with perfectionists and you will fit right in. You will have time, budget and resources as required to make the most stunning creations the healthcare world has ever seen.</p>
<p>
	If you&#39;re reading this and you&#39;re feeling spark run down your spine, then give us a call and let us give you the most exciting, challenging and mind bendingly frustrating job you could dream of.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The right salary</li>
	<li>
		Working with brilliant people</li>
	<li>
		Being challenged in every way possible to excel again and again</li>
	<li>
		Private health insurance in case you&#39;re over challenged.</li>
</ul>
