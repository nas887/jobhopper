	We&#39;re Appy Couple. We&#39;re in NY (on a rooftop where Spiderman was shot). We&#39;re venture-backed. We&#39;ve graduated from ER Accelerator (eranyc.com). We have fun doing what we do and we&#39;ve all left our 5-star corporate jobs to be Appy!</p>
<p>
	We&#39;re in Beta right now and are flattered by some of the love we&#39;ve received.</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Why work at Appy:</u></strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>
		We have some very exciting works in the pipeline and can&#39;t talk about it much here</li>
	<li>
		We have an awesome office with 360 degree NYC views (and a terrace).</li>
	<li>
		Health insurance, dental, vision and all the stuff you need to beathe (and drink)</li>
	<li>
		We love clean simple and classy design that would be appreciated anywhere from Berlin to Tokyo</li>
	<li>
		We&#39;d love to have you in the office with us, but we know you need your space sometimes--we&#39;re flexible with work hours and working from home</li>
	<li>
		We know you want to be part of the startup life, but need to make a GOOD living and get stock options and build a pretty enviable product</li>
</ol>
<p>
	<u><strong>Why you need to work at Appy:</strong></u></p>
<ol>
	<li>
		You&#39;re bound for greatness</li>
	<li>
		Have&nbsp;experience building consumer-facing websites from front to back</li>
	<li>
		Have used popular libraries for development (jQuery, SASS, etc)</li>
	<li>
		Have worked with Ruby on Rails--infact you&#39;re pretty good at it</li>
	<li>
		Have worked with AWS or other similar hosted solutions</li>
	<li>
		Get the hang of (X)HTML, CSS, semantic layout techniques, JavaScript, and JavaScript frameworks (jQuery, JQuery Mobile)</li>
	<li>
		Solid experience with development technologies (PHP, RoR), basic data mining (JSON, XML, open APIs),&nbsp;and development of popular blog/CMS frameworks (WordPress, Drupal, etc.).</li>
	<li>
		Comfortable using version control systems (Git, Subversion, etc.) individually or in a team setting</li>
</ol>
