<p>
<strong>Senior Software Engineer:</strong> use Java to write e-commerce solutions to enable uber-customizable products and experience instantly to our customers.</p>
<br />
<p>
<u><strong>What You Will be Doing</strong></u><br />
Working as a Senior Software Developer for an Agile team. Writing a new pricing engine that drives the entire site. Creating a new product publishing system that will allow us to release new products all the time. Developing new ways for people to create just what they want. We are not just an e-commerce company. We&rsquo;re different and we have complex, challenging, and fun problems to solve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<u><strong>Who You Are</strong></u><br />
You see code in your sleep. Sometimes you wake up with a better solution to some problem you solved. You have at least five years of engineering experience and in that time you took on good size projects by yourself. When there is some nasty bug, you&rsquo;re the person the team heads to for answers, advice, and help. You have a history of sound engineering decisions, for technology, approach, and algorithms. You want to work on a high-velocity agile team.</p>
<p>
<u><strong>Who We Are</strong></u><br />
We write software to generate prices and images in real-time. Our customers customize their piece on our website and they just aren&rsquo;t going to wait. We have to be fast, we have to be right, and we have to look good. We work with all sorts of technologies: non-relational databases like MongoDB, indexing with Solr, job distribution with Hadoop, new frameworks like Grails. We have a datacenter but we&rsquo;re good with the cloud too. We are an Agile shop and we release at the end of every sprint. You want to see your code, your features, your work in production fast, that&rsquo;s us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<u><strong>What You Need to do to Succeed</strong></u><br />
You need to work independently to develop new features and resolve single-system bugs. You need to accurately estimate complexity and work for moderate projects. You need to be an excellent teammate, helping the agile team deliver on projects on time. You need to think like a product owner, understanding what needs to be done, and drive towards the MVP. You will need to learn fast, think on your feet, and jump right on in.</p>
