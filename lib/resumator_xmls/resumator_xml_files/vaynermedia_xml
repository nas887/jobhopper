At VaynerMedia, we&rsquo;re lucky that everyone within our walls thinks creatively, shares a passion for building communities, and understands the world of micro-content.&nbsp; Our copywriters serve a slightly different role than more traditional &ldquo;digital creative types,&rdquo; but thankfully we&rsquo;ll never use the term &ldquo;digital ninja.&rdquo;</p>

<li>
You&rsquo;ll care more about concepting, writing, developing, and putting the team in the best position to present our ideas than you do about getting credit for the work</li>
<li>
You&rsquo;re expected to be as much of a friendly teacher as a proficient doer when working within our Account team structure</li>
<li>
You&rsquo;ll have strong storytelling skills and a mastery of grammar and the English language</li>
<li>
You&rsquo;ll occasionally help to mentor junior members of the team</li>

<li>
You&rsquo;ll be able present complex ideas using simple, marketing-speak-free language and visuals</li>
<li>
You&rsquo;ll care about concepting, developing, and putting the team in the best position to present our ideas way more than you do about getting credit for the work you do</li>
<li>
You&rsquo;ll use (and develop) qualitative and quantitative research to guide insights about areas of opportunities for our clients</li>
<li>
You&rsquo;re expected to be as much of a friendly teacher as a proficient doer when working within our Account team structure</li>
</ul>
<p>
The ideal candidate has:</p>
<ul>
<li>
A Bachelor&rsquo;s degree and 3-6 years of digital / social / brand strategy experience, developing and helping execute on digital / social strategies + campaigns, including client-facing experience</li>

An innate ability to synthesize various data, learnings, and research to articulate the most important and actionable insights</li>
<li>
Strong visual thinking and story-telling abilities, simplifying complex concepts and strategies through design and logic</li>

A sparkling personality that will mesh well with the existing VaynerMedia family (we love smart people with a dash of quirkiness and humor)</li>
