	Most online shopping, coupons, rewards, loyalty, and social shopping websites suck. Fact. Online and offline commerce is boring. Stale. Not engaging. And nobody has to shop for stuff every day - so how do retailers / advertisers make their brands more relevant on a daily basis?</p>
<p>
	GoSave is tackling an incredibly massive problem in a lucrative market - and solving the problem in a totally unique way. If you&rsquo;re interested in solving this simple but massive problem in the $100B e-commerce space and $35B digital advertising industry, then join the GoSave team so we can work together to change the world and make shopping / finding deals more social, engaging, and rewarding.</p>
<p>
	GoSave isn&#39;t a &quot;me-too&quot; company. We&#39;re not coming up with the next big &quot;social game&quot; and we&#39;re not just some lame coupon or rewards website. Although it may look like that early on (can you say, cash flow?). We&#39;re the kind of company where people scratch their heads when they first see what we&#39;re doing. Then after a five minute conversation, begin to throw around words like &quot;brilliant&quot; &quot;huge&quot; &quot;potential&quot; and &quot;fish tacos.&quot;</p>
<p>
	GoSave is a totally awesome, kick-ass (to use the most technical jargon), and well funded startup based in the beautiful and sunny beach community of Santa Monica, CA. We&rsquo;re a small, tight-knit team looking to add talented, hardworking, and energetic team members to help us solve big problems and have fun while doing it.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br />
	This position is for Senior Software Engineer (aka the &ldquo;Lead Magician&rdquo;). You will work with our existing team and help add new team members. GoSave is a pretty massive product, so expect to get your hands dirty fast.</p>
<p>
	You need to be able to figure things out. Think ahead. Propose your own ideas. And Own the product. If you need direction every single day on what to do, then don&rsquo;t bother applying.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>WE ARE</strong><br />
	In one word: awesome. In two-words: hard working. And hopefully more awesome once you join the team.</p>
<p>
	GoSave is an a consumer web and mobile application pioneering the use of game play &amp; social interaction to connect brands with the most active, engaged, and loyal online consumers.</p>
<p>
	For consumers, GoSave is a fun and rewarding way to shop with friends and save money through deals and rewards at their favorite brands.</p>
<p>
	For retailers and advertisers, GoSave is a direct response advertising platform to acquire &amp; retain loyal consumers, increase average order size, and drive more sales.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>YOU ARE</strong></p>
<p>
	A totally awesome developer who codes the Mona Lisa in your sleep using any language. Ruby. Node.js. Python. PHP. Java. No matter the language, you eat-breathe-sleep and FANTASIZE about your code.</p>
<p>
	You want to make an impact on a small-team and forge the future of the product from the fire in your belly. You want to come in late (because you&rsquo;ll be in the office until 4 AM anyways), work through lunch, not bathe for days--nay... WEEKS, and occasionally step away from your terminal to have a Happy Hour drink with the team.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		3+ years experience with LAMP / PHP / Ubuntu / Python / Any weapon of choice</li>
	<li>
		Tons of experience developing web applications</li>
	<li>
		Knowledge of Javascript, HTML5, XML, MySQL, Linux, and Object Oriented stuff</li>
	<li>
		Lover of Mootools / jQuery / Node.js</li>
	<li>
		Experience scaling, distributed systems, and large analytics systems</li>
	<li>
		Great sense of humor</li>
</ul>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>COMPENSATION</strong><br />
	Salary, benefits, and equity. This is a startup job, so it&rsquo;s not for everybody. You need to be comfortable with ambiguity, responsibility, and limited guidance (read: no-hand holding). We will expect you to work a lot of hours, be flexible, and be a fun contributor to the team.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>COVER LETTER</strong><br />
	When submitting your application, please provide a cover letter with a detailed technical case study of one of your recent / related projects. Please include technical architecture, your contribution, pros / cons of the architecture, and what you would have improve about the project.</p>
<p>
	If you have a Github you want to share, link to that.&nbsp;</p>
