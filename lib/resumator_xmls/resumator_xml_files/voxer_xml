Although we&#39;re primarily focused on hiring engineers right now, we don&#39;t want to discourage other candidates to apply, even if you&#39;re not suitable for any of the roles we currently have listed. &nbsp;Please feel free to submit a general application, but specify very clearly what you&#39;re looking to work on. &nbsp;We&#39;d love to hear from you!</p>
<p>

<p>
<strong>Voxer</strong></p>
<p>
Voxer is more than just a walkie-talkie app, it is one of the most used Push-to-Talk and messaging applications in the world. Voxer iOS and Android apps allow tens of millions of users across the world to communicate instantly. We&#39;re making voice and multimedia communication faster, more efficient, and more social. Our goal is ambitious - we&#39;re building the next generation communication voice service at the intersection between PTT, phone calls, SMS, conference calls, and multimedia messaging.</p>
<p>
It&#39;s no small feat to achieve, to keep one of the world&#39;s fastest growing voice applications humming along and growing at a phenomenal pace. But we are 50 dedicated individuals who are putting some of the most exciting technology in the world to work right now - we are the world&#39;s largest Node.js site, and we also run one of the largest Riak clusters in the world.</p>
<p>
We are dedicated and solely focused on building the next generation of communication. The problems we&#39;re facing are at a scale only seen at companies like Twitter and Facebook and we&#39;re looking for exceptional people who can help us tackle them.</p>
<p>
We closed our first outside round of funding last spring, and our brand new offices are right off Market Street in San Francisco. There&#39;s tons of restaurants and shopping nearby at Westfield and Union Square to spend your hard earned cash on, and if you&#39;re a musician there&#39;s a few outside on the street that we wouldn&#39;t mind you teaching a few new songs to. There are plenty of MUNI lines right outside, BART is a block away, plus the Ferry to Oakland and Marin is a pleasant fifteen minute stroll or five minute bus ride away.</p>
