&bull; Super connectors. You enjoy meeting anyone and everyone.<br />
&bull; People that smile a lot. We like happy people</p>
<p>
Responsibilities:<br />
&bull; Prospect and develop new relationships into business opportunities<br />

&bull; Work independently, be able to prioritize and focus, and take initiative<br />
&bull; Think out of the box and get stuff done</p>
<p>
