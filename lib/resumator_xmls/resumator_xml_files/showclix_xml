	<strong>About ShowClix:</strong></p>
<p>
	ShowClix is proudly based in downtown Pittsburgh, PA, within walking distance of dozens of great restaurants and PNC Park. Internship perks include a competitive stipend, educational credit hours* and a truly rad office equipped with a snack wall and projection screen cinema lounge. To learn more about daily life at ShowClix, visit <a href="http://www.showclix.com/culture">http://www.showclix.com/culture</a>.</p>
<p>
	Back in 2007, founders Lynsie Campbell and Joshua Dziabiak created ShowClix as an online ticketing and live event search engine. From a one-room office with a couple of computers and a ping-pong table, the company eventually evolved into the full-service event ticketing system that it is today.</p>
<p>
	Millions of tickets, three offices, and two cereal walls later, we&rsquo;re the preferred ticketing solution for thousands of performing arts theatres, live music venues, and festivals&mdash;as well as museums, non-profit fundraisers, nightclubs, even circuses and rodeos.</p>
