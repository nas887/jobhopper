<strong>Neverware</strong> is bringing about a revolution in education technology by enabling schools to run cutting-edge software on aging hardware.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
We manufacture proprietary servers with the ability to make dozens of Windows&nbsp; virtual machines available on a school&rsquo;s local area network, and thereby to transform every terminal in the school into a powerful workstation that never needs to be replaced. Our early success is attributable to our founder&rsquo;s key insight: by leveraging open-source technologies, a small, agile development team, and the vision of a turnkey implementation process, it will soon be possible to bring full-scale desktop virtualization &ndash; a technology that until now has only been available to Fortune 500 companies &ndash; to schools around the world. The company is disrupting the 3-5 year hardware refresh cycle, and is rapidly gaining recognition for helping financially challenged schools provide students with the IT resources they deserve, reduce unnecessary spending, and cut back on environmental waste.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
<strong>Neverware&rsquo;s engineering team</strong> works continuously to solve the wide range of challenges that must be surmounted to realize our technological vision. We are dedicated and highly collaborative. Each and every member of our team has and will continue to see their own code ship on a regular basis, providing each engineer with a unique opportunity to put his or her individual stamp on a product that is literally being snatched up as fast as we can push it out.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
What we expect in a candidate:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
<li>
Experience developing complex software in a collaborative environment</li>
<li>
A strong commitment to quality workmanship and effective process</li>
<li>
A scientific, methodical and efficient approach to solving difficult problems</li>
<li>
A natural inclination to learn from others, and teach them what you know</li>
<li>
Interest in computer networks, virtualization, the inner workings of linux, and the zen of python</li>
<li>
A good sense of humor and a serious commitment to hanging out</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
What a candidate can expect from us:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
<li>
A challenging workspace where passion and energy are rewarded with rapid advancement</li>
<li>
A collaborative lab environment where scientific principles are leveraged to create next-generation technology</li>
<li>
A competitive salary with equity participation in the company&rsquo;s success</li>
<li>
The opportunity to provide students across the city, the nation, and eventually the globe with the resources they need to become full citizens of the information age</li>
</ul>
