	Live Support Ninjas are responsible for providing our customers with extraordinary customer service and support over the telephone and live chat. In addition to technical prowess, our Live Support Ninjas need to posses customer service skills that are way beyond average and also have an attitude and personality that makes them suited to work with people (our customers and their co-workers!) and make those people happy.</p>
<p>
	To attract the best talent and give our team members the most flexibility, A Small Orange lets its employees work from wherever they want, as long as they have a reliable, high speed Internet connection and can work reliably and be depended upon. At A Small Orange, personal and professional accountability is extremely important and starts with your work schedule and environment.</p>
<p>
	Part Time (less than 40 hours) and Flex Time (non-standard shifts) are available. Compensation is dependent upon experience and skillset.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Basics:</strong> All of our Live Support Ninjas need to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Must be customer-focused, and willing to do whatever it takes to resolve customer issues. Going above and beyond is the standard at A Small Orange.</li>
	<li>
		Excellent written and spoken English. Live Support Ninjas must be quick to provide helpful and friendly answers over the phone and live chat.</li>

	<li>
		Must be able to ask customers for complete error message or derive the context of their problem if they provide insufficient information.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Bonus:</strong> If our Live Support Ninjas know this stuff already, great. If not, they&#39;ll learn it in training and on the job:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Advanced knowledge of any of the above technologies.</li>

	<li>
		Confidence with distributed version control systems (We use git)</li>
	<li>
		In-depth understanding of LAMP or similar application stacks</li>
	<li>
		Experience with optimizing code through profiling</li>
	<li>
		Understanding of Unix/Linux fundamentals and system administration</li>
	<li>
		Experience with virtualization (Xen, KVM, LXC, etc)</li>
	<li>
		Knowledge of networking, sockets, file systems, etc</li>
	<li>
		Experience utilizing high performance relational databases (experience with NoSQL systems is a plus!)</li>
	<li>
		Understanding of JavaScript and JS frameworks (Events, Closures, AJAX, jQuery)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Extra Bonus:</strong> If our Developers also know this stuff, we are especially interested in their skills and they should let us know that they have:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		In-depth understanding of Javascript (prototypal inheritance, closures, events, ajax, etc)</li>
	<li>
		Experience with at least one major javascript framework (jquery preferred)</li>
	<li>

	<li>
		The ability to write well-crafted, semantic HTML</li>
