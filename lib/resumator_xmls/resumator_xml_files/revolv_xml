&nbsp; &nbsp; Here at Revolv, we believe design is problem solving.&nbsp; We&#39;re solving big problems, like how to keep your house safe with an app you never open, and how to sell a product that doesn&#39;t work until you&#39;ve bought a piece of hardware.&nbsp; As such, we need incredible design.&nbsp; Design that starts from how people actually use their houses and their phones, and grows into something light and fun and delightful.&nbsp; Design with its feet grounded in UX and its head in the clouds.&nbsp; We&#39;re not making a remote control for your house, we&#39;re making your house revolv (yup, can&#39;t help ourselves) around you!&nbsp; It&#39;s an experience not just a product!</p>
<p>
<strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You spend as much time with a sketch book as you do photoshop.&nbsp; You take pride in making complicated things look simple.&nbsp; You adjust the font size of your designs based on their screen size.&nbsp; You know you shouldn&#39;t use blend modes, but you can&#39;t always stop yourself.&nbsp; You refuse to design a website that doesn&#39;t support retina display.&nbsp; You delight in delighters.&nbsp; You&#39;ve seen Helvetica.&nbsp; You use dribbble, and not just for redesigning iOS 7 icons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; You know that design is all about the details, but you don&#39;t lose sight of the bigger picture, how people actually use what you are making.</p>
<p>
<strong>Please submit your Dribbble profile in the&nbsp;Website, Blog or Portfolio link.</strong></p>
