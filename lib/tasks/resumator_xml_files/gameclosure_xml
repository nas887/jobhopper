	Come join the team of SDK Mobile Publishing Tools at Game Closure, where we are building the world&#39;s most advanced HTML5 game engine.

This position involves working closely with the analytics and game engine teams, so our ideal candidates would be smart, passionate, and well-rounded engineers.</p>
