<strong>About MindSnacks</strong></p>
<p>
At MindSnacks we build fun, touch-based, educational games that teach languages and other subjects. We take the fun part very seriously! Ironic, right? Learning has this inexplicable boring reputation, and we are here to change that. If you&rsquo;re interested in gaming or mobile, you should probably apply because we do both AND eat cookies. At the same time.</p>
<p>
Joining our team is like joining a family. We&rsquo;re fun and occasionally a little insane, but don&rsquo;t hold it against us! We might make you wear a fake mustache all day, and you wouldn&rsquo;t be the first mustache victim. Costumery aside, every one of us is passionate about revolutionizing the way people learn. Walking into our studio every day feels less like work and more like a chipping away at a worthwhile mission. Everyone at MindSnacks makes an impact and is treated like a partner; we hold each other to very high standards and work hard by our own volition.</p>
<p>
We were recently named educational app of the year by Apple, and are currently the number one way to learn a language and study for the SATs in the App store. We love what we do and are honored and lucky to be given the opportunity to get our games into the hands of over four million people. We are backed by top-tier VCs and angel investors and are based in the wonderful city of San Francisco, California. Interested in joining our rapidly-growing family? Send your info our way.</p>
