	<u><strong>What We Are Looking For</strong></u></p>
<p>
	 As we acquire new customers we are looking to add a person dedicated to supporting our clients throughout the data migration process. This person would step in after the point of sale to take the customer through our proven step-by-step process. Communication with the client will primarily be via email and phone during regular business hours, with occasional exceptions.</p>
<p>
	<u><strong>You&hellip; </strong></u></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Should be excited to work directly with clients (we are!) </li>
	<li>
		Should be a problem solver who is interested in learning new things and attentively addressing client issues. </li>
	<li>
		Should be familiar with Google Apps, other email systems and DNS. </li>
	<li>
		Should be comfortable working in the command-line for certain tasks (or very eager to learn how).</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<u><strong>How to Get an Interview:</strong></u></p>
<p>
	Submit the following four tings:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		When a customer wants to direct mail to a new Google Apps domain what must be done to the MX records?</li>
	<li>
		Provide the MX records for the following domains: -improffice.com -facebook.com -google.com</li>
	<li>
		One example of a time you helped a customer.</li>
	<li>
		Links to your social media presence (LinkedIn, twitter, etc). See if you can pull off not sending a resume. If not, send that thing over instead.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	<u><strong>Time Commitment &amp; Compensation</strong></u></p>
<p>
	We are looking for someone to start out part-time or full-time as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
