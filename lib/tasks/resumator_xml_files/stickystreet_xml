	<strong>Do you have a business mind and an outgoing personality? The StickyStreet team wants you.</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>The task</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		You will contribute to real projects we&rsquo;re developing at StickyStreet.</li>
	<li>
		We are primarily focused on expanding our Global footprint through new Sales Channels&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		We expect you to be comfortable with sales and making new relationships.</li>
	<li>
		As part of a closely-knit team, your words and actions will have a real impact on group business decisions.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		We expect you to be involved in all parts of the Sales process, including marketing, attraction, closing, and support.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		We are a customer service company at heart. We hope you think people are awesome.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		We expect you to perform well independently and with supervision.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		You will be here to learn and to work. &nbsp;We won&#39;t drive you into the ground, but we expect you to work as hard as the rest of our small team.</li>
	<li>
		The entire Washington D.C. team at StickyStreet is just six people. &nbsp;Sales are currently done by one or two people. &nbsp;You will not be ignored or put in a corner.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Ideally, you could join us early in September.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>The skills</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The ability to open your mouth and speak and a willingness to learn are crucial for this position.</li>
	<li>
		You should have a positive outlook on life and should be able to convey enthusiasm over the phone.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		As an intern, we do not expect you to walk in the door with a full suite of expert skills.</li>
	<li>
		Experience in sales or customer service positions (ie, food &amp; bev, hospitality) are the most important skills you can bring to the table.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		We hope you are proficient with Mac OS X and are reasonably knowledgeable using the web.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>The basics</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Yes, you need to be able to sell over the phone and email.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		No, you don&#39;t need any formal education, but a formal education won&#39;t hurt your chances.</li>
	<li>
		Yes, this is a paid internship. No, we won&#39;t pay you a zillion dollars.</li>
	<li>
		Yes, there is the opportunity to earn commission if you are a rock star.</li>
	<li>
		Yes, you already need to be able to work legally in the US of A (sorry Brits).</li>
	<li>
		Yes, you need to be able to come to our D.C. office most days of your internship.</li>
	<li>
		No, age and race do not make a difference.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<br />
	<strong>The application</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		A cover letter is nice, but don&#39;t kill yourself creating the perfect letter. &nbsp;Be direct about what you expect to get out of the internship and why you&#39;re our ideal candidate. &nbsp;Pithiness is a virtue.</li>
	<li>
		If we like how you present yourself on paper, we will like to see how you present yourself over the phone, and next, in person.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		A resume would be useful, but is not the primary means of choosing a candidate. &nbsp; Again, please be concise.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Have questions? Please email: david@stickystreet.com</li>
</ul>
