Liquid Web is on the lookout for committed, enthusiastic testers to help our software development group produce the best products on the market.&nbsp; The rapid growth the company continues to enjoy has put a premium on enhanced automation.&nbsp; To make this possible, the software development group is expanding with an emphasis on the need for additional Quality Assurance (QA) team members. These positions are integral to the success of the company&#39;s burgeoning development department.</p>
<p>
Our developers undertake a great deal of responsibility, including writing their own unit tests, which leaves the QA department free to focus on endeavors such as System testing, Non-functional testing and beyond.&nbsp; In our continued development, we strive to maintain a balance amongst running our test plans, handling all of the new functionality tests in the cycle, regression testing, test automation, and exploratory testing -- not to mention, approaching everyone&#39;s favorite non-functional tests such as performance and destructive testing.&nbsp; Candidates who enjoy a challenging and cutting edge environment will find a great deal of excitement in the developing technologies we encounter as we continue to build and automate all aspects of our Data Center.&nbsp; The ability to multi-task and communicate effectively are required traits for any candidate that we consider, as the job requirements include everything from front-end testing, to juggling multiple long-running tests, to maintaining the exemplary customer experience Liquid Web has become known for.</p>

Clear verbal and written communication.</li>
<li>
Ability to trouble-shoot effectively and solve problems.</li>
<li>
Ability to coordinate with multiple internal teams.</li>
<li>
Good time management and the ability to be self-motivated.</li>
<li>
Previous software quality assurance experience, or related experience in software development.</li>
<li>
Understanding of the software development life cycle.</li>
<li>
Familiarity with the various aspects of the software quality assurance discipline such as testing methodologies (black box, white box), types of tests (Non-functional, Regression, User Acceptance), and other test topics (Scope).</li>
<li>
Experience with designing and running tests.</li>
<li>
Experience with &lsquo;* as a Service&rdquo; offerings.</li>
<li>
Experience with web related APIs.</li>
<li>
Technical background with some of the following: server operating systems (Linux, Windows), web technologies (HTML, Javascript), Networking, Virtualization</li>
<li>
Any type of scripting, especially for automating tasks. (Bonus points for knowing Perl).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
Benefits:</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
Great working environment.</li>
<li>
Exposure to state-of-the-art technology.</li>
<li>

	We&#39;re looking for talented developers to join our growing team and to deliver quality software. We have a focus on modern best practices such as automated testing, rapid releases, distributed version control, and object-oriented code. The growing need for automated deployment in the hosting industry means we get to interact with burgeoning technologies like virtualization, distributed systems, and automated network configuration. We&#39;re looking for more smart people to help us build out our Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings and customer portals, as well as maintain and modernize our existing internal applications.</p>
<p>
	We leverage open source technologies (Perl, PostgreSQL, CPAN, CentOS) and are working towards a culture of contributing back to the community. Liquid Web still maintains a lot of its start-up roots, so self-starters with a get-it-done attitude thrive. We want people who strive to push things forward on the team and who aren&#39;t afraid to tackle a project head-on without a lot of hand-holding. The ability to juggle multiple projects simultaneously and prioritize them effectively is a must.</p>
<p>
	We have need for developers at all experience levels and with various skill sets. Our ideal applicant would have many of these skills:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Solid development fundamentals with a good understanding of object-oriented programming</li>
	<li>
		Thorough experience in Perl or a proven track record of strong development in other languages with the ability to quickly learn and embrace Perl.</li>
	<li>
		Confidence with distributed version control systems (We use git)</li>
	<li>
		Experience with unit testing and a recognition of the immense value it provides</li>
	<li>
		Familiarity with CPAN and the plethora of quality packages it provides. (We use HTML::Mason, DateTime, Log::Log4perl, DBIx::Class, Test::Class, Devel::NYTProf and much more)</li>
	<li>
		In-depth understanding of LAMP or similar application stacks</li>
	<li>
		Experience with optimizing code through profiling</li>
	<li>
		Understanding of Unix/Linux fundamentals and system administration</li>
	<li>
		Experience with virtualization (Xen, KVM, LXC, etc)</li>
	<li>
		Knowledge of networking, sockets, file systems, etc</li>
	<li>
		Experience utilizing high performance relational databases (experience with NoSQL systems is a plus!)</li>
	<li>
		Web centric user interface design (HTML, CSS)</li>
	<li>
		Understanding of JavaScript and JS frameworks (Events, Closures, AJAX, jQuery)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Whether you are a specialist working on network code, or a generalist reaching across various skill sets, as long as you are willing to learn, we want to hear from you.</p>
<p>
	Benefits:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Great working environment</li>
	<li>
		Exposure to state-of-the-art technology</li>
	<li>
		Free hosting account</li>
	<li>
		Health/Dental coverage</li>
	<li>
		Optional Employer contributing IRA</li>
	<li>
		Compensation is competitive, based on experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	If you&#39;d like to join us in our endeavors, please send a resume and code sample. If you don&#39;t have any code that you can share, write something up and send it. Links to github/cpan/sourceforge projects that you worked on are encouraged, but please specify what area you worked on if it was part of a larger group effort.</p>
<p>
	We have offices in both Lansing, MI and Scottsdale, AZ, and we&#39;re willing to relocate the right candidate. We do allow occasional telecommuting, but we are not open to full-time telecommuters or contractors at this time.</p>
