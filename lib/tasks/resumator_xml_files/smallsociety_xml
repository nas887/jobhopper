	Are you a Cocoa Developer with a passion for the iOS Platform? Do you live in Portland, Oregon, and love it? Would like to apply your skill set by working on high-profile iPhone and iPad apps for some of the world&#39;s leading brands?</p>

<p>
	<strong>About Us</strong></p>

We have passion for the iOS platform and are dedicated to helping organizations bring great ideas to life. Clients have included Zipcar, Amazon, Whole Foods Market, The Democratic Party, and many other well-known organizations. Members of the Small Society team were previously responsible for the successful creation of Obama &#39;08, the official iPhone application for the Obama Campaign, in Fall 2008.&nbsp;We are a small company with a great downtown Portland location, and you would be working with smart &amp; fun co-workers who care deeply about the quality of their work.</p>

		You think of yourself primarily as a developer, even though you may have a diversity of skills to offer.</li>

		You live in or near Portland, Oregon, and are looking for a full-time position in the rapidly growing iPhone market. (Or, you&#39;re ready to pick up and relocate to Portland right away!)</li>
	<li>
		You understand the value of the software development process.</li>
	<li>
		You have experience working with wireframes.</li>
	<li>
		You are willing to work solo or in a team on iPhone and iPad development projects.</li>
	<li>
		You are a fan of Apple technologies, including iOS and Mac OS.</li>
	<li>
		You love learning and problem solving.</li>
	<li>
		You have experience working with a formal QA process and proper bug handling.</li>
	<li>
		You have good communication skills and a positive attitude.</li>
	<li>
