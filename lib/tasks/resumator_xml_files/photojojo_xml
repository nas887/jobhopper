			<description><![CDATA[<p>
Hello! We&#39;re Photojojo and we&#39;re looking for a full-time e-commerce Buyer with a love for cameras, and a knack for numbers.</p>
<p>
<strong>About us</strong></p>
<p>
We&#39;re a (tiny) company making photography awesome in a BIG way. We run the <strong><a href="http://photojojo.com/store">most fun online shop</a></strong> you&#39;ve EVER seen, <a href="http://photojojo.com/book">wrote a book</a>, have over 600,000 subscribers, fans, and followers, and we&#39;ve been in the New York Times, Today Show, Wired, Readymade, and <a href="http://photojojo.com/press">lots more</a>.</p>
<p>
We&#39;re building a small but awesome team that loves working together. (Seriously, last year <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/photojojolovesyou/sets/72157625635534001/"><strong>we took the company to India for 3 weeks</strong></a>!)</p>
<p>
<strong>What you&#39;ll be learning ...</strong></p>
<p>
We&#39;re all about finding the most rarest photo goodies in the world. We&#39;ve done a pretty good job so far, but we know there&#39;s much, much more to conquer.</p>
<p>
It&#39;s your job to conquer -- and pick up some new skills along the way!</p>
<p>
That means constantly searching for awesome new stuffs while being responsible for the sales and profitability of the existing products in the shop.</p>
<p>
<strong>As a Photojojo Treasure Hunter your responsibilities will be divided between:</strong></p>
<p>
Analyzing Sales - Poring over sales data, looking for trends in our sales and the industry, and making inventory projections. Also, ensuring we have healthy inventory levels and quality products (placing fill-in orders, finding alternate vendors, handling returns, quality control, etc.)</p>
<p>
Buying - Scouring the Internet (and the Earth) to find the latest and greatest photo goodies. You&#39;ll be doing a lot of web research and a bit of travel (from Vegas trade shows to Hong Kong street markets).</p>
<p>
Back at home you&#39;ll be staying on top of the latest gadgets and gear, developing relationships with vendors, negotiating, and helping launch new items in the shop.</p>
<p>
<strong>About You ...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>You&#39;re a planner.</strong> You&#39;re obsessively obnoxiously neurotically organized, and you can&#39;t live without lists. Your sock drawer is color-coordinated and you have a Google spreadsheet for your DVD collection.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tech head</strong>. You know cameras and electronics and are on top of the latest photo gadgets. You&#39;ve probably read the Wikipedia page on lens optics just for fun. More than once.</li>
<li>
<strong>Organized</strong>. Not just normal organized. Obsessively obnoxiously neurotically organized. Your sock drawer is color coordinated and you have a Google spreadsheet for your DVD collection.</li>
<li>
<strong>Like to travel</strong>. You&#39;ve traveled internationally before (ideally for business). You know you shouldn&#39;t drink the tap water, or too much beer during a business meeting. You can navigate foreign streets as if they were your own. You&#39;re also a whiz at trip planning and travel research.</li>
<li>
<strong>Great taste</strong>. You&#39;ve got it - simply put. It&#39;s not unusual for you to get compliments on your curatorial habit.</li>
<li>
Have<strong> mad negotiating skillz</strong>. You&#39;re not afraid to ask for what you want. And you&#39;ve got the common sense to know when you&#39;re asking for too much.</li>
<li>
You can <strong>kick-ass with minimal supervision</strong>. You&#39;re used to setting your own deadlines and sticking to &#39;em. Or else.</li>
<li>
<strong>Stats and number loving whiz</strong>. Very important. You eat data for breakfast and wash it down with formulas. (Models and regressions wouldn&rsquo;t hurt!) You love pie charts and pie, equally.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fun to work with.</strong> We think work should be fun, and working with friends is a big part of that.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
<strong>How to Apply</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
Take a look at <a href="http://photojojo.com/store">our shop</a> to get a feel for what we&rsquo;re all about.</li>
<li>
Find 10-15 products you think would be a great fit for our store. (Send us links or pics.)</li>
<li>
Include it in a cover letter also telling us why you&#39;re a perfect fit for the job.</li>
<li>
&hellip; be sure to include your resume!</li>
<li>
Then submit it all using the form at right!</li>
</ol>

<strong>CALLING ALL PHOTO-OBSESSED INTERNET-LOVIN&#39; CRAFTERS</strong></p>
<p>
We&rsquo;re Photojojo and we&rsquo;re looking for a Community Leader to show the world all the amazing things you can do with the goods in our shop.</p>
<p>
<strong>ABOUT US</strong></p>
<p>
We&#39;re a (tiny) company that&#39;s all about making photography awesome in a BIG way.</p>
<p>
We run the most fun online shop you&#39;ve EVER seen, wrote abook, have over 1.8 Million subscribers, fans, and followers, and we&#39;ve been in the New York Times, Today Show, Wired, Readymade, and lots more.</p>
<p>
We&#39;re building a small, awesome team that loves working together. (Seriously, this year we took the company to Thailand!</p>
<p>
<strong>WHAT THE HEY IS A COMMUNITY LEADER?</strong></p>
<p>
Life is grand. We&rsquo;ve got a shop full-o-awesome and jillions of adoring fans. But there&rsquo;s something missing in Photojojoland.</p>
<p>
That&rsquo;s where you come in. We&rsquo;re looking for someone to create, curate and spread the most amazing posts, pics, and projects about our shop this side of the Internet.</p>
<p>
Since the beginning, our mission has been to inspire people to take more photos and to have more fun doing it. That&rsquo;s why we opened our store&mdash;to give people the tools they need to create.</p>
<p>
There&rsquo;s a zillion and one ways to play with the tools and toys in our shop; we want people to see them all! Your job is to make that happen.</p>
<p>
<strong>AS SHOP COMMUNITY LEADER YOU&#39;LL BE IN CHARGE OF ...&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>Creating Really Really Cool Sh*z -</strong> You&rsquo;ll inspire people with new ways to use the goods in our shop. Are there 101 Different Ways to Use a Lens Mug? Rest assured, you&rsquo;ll find out and tell the world.</p>
<p>
<strong>Curating The Best Stuff Out There -</strong> You&rsquo;ll reach out to the tech and photo community for jaw-dropping projects and photos using Photojojo treasures.</p>
<p>
<strong>Experimenting -</strong> It&rsquo;s your mission to come up with the best ways to spread the Photojojo gospel. Photojojo Tupperware Party? Sure. Photojojo Space Shuttle Station with lunar phoneography walks? OK! You&rsquo;ll do it all!</p>
<p>
<strong>Measuring and Optimizing -</strong> With all that experimenting you&rsquo;ll want to make sure people are listening. A big part of your job is analyzing your efforts to make them the best they can be.</p>
<p>
<b>ABOUT YOU</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
You love all types of Photography. From the iPhone in your pocket to the Holga in your hand to the Canon 5D round your neck. You heart anything that makes a photo happen.</li>
<li>
You like to tinker and you make things. One man&#39;s trash is another man&#39;s pizza box pinhole camera. The other day you turned your dog into a tripod and a camera dolly. Before lunch.</li>
<li>
You&#39;re a Jack or Janet of all trades. You can do anything! You&#39;re an artist, writer, photographer, videographer and master friend-maker above all. Sometimes you bake cookies.</li>
<li>
You&#39;re fun. We think work should be fun, and working with fun folks is a big part of that.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>WHERE</strong></p>
<p>
We&#39;re located in the Mission District in San Francisco and are seeking someone local or someone who wants to be local. (We can help with moving expenses.)</p>
<p>
We have lots of sit-stand desks, 27&quot; displays, roof access, and fruit delivery. You&#39;ll get to pick out your own computer, and our office is bike-friendly, dog-friendly, and dinosaur-friendly.</p>
<p>
<strong>HOW TO APPLY</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
Pick a favorite photo tool and give us&nbsp;10 holy-cow-how&#39;d-you-think-of-that inspiring things to do with it.</li>
<li>
... Then do one! Give us photos, a short write-up (in Photojojo voice) and some&nbsp;fun ideas on how to share your project..</li>
<li>
Write a cover letter telling us why you&#39;re the perfect fit. And don&#39;t forget to attach a resume.</li>
</ol>
