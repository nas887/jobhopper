<em>Great Ideas.</em><br />
We&rsquo;re really passionate about solving big problems facing educational institutions as they look to increase student outcomes.</p>
<p>
Video is increasingly becoming a huge component of the way that many people learn globally and we&rsquo;re only starting to see how video can help all kinds of educational institutions and are always looking for new ideas on where to take our products next. We&rsquo;d love to hear some of your ideas on how video and technology could be integrated into educational institutions.</p>
<p>
<em>Award Winning Technology.</em><br />
If you enjoy working with engineers and designers who build really awesome software, then look no further. FastCompany just ranked MediaCore as one of the &ldquo;Top 10 Most Innovative Companies in Digital Video&rdquo; and while we&rsquo;ve been thrilled with that nomination (along with 8 other awards we&rsquo;ve won this year), we&rsquo;re really motivated by coming into work every day and just building a great product that&rsquo;s solving real problems.</p>
<p>
Our team is passionate about Open Source technology. We love Git, Python, Ruby, Google Closure, FFMPEG, and HTML5, but we especially love combining all these things with design and aesthetics that are unrivaled in our industry and are making a big impact in the classroom.</p>
<p>
<em>Startup Mentality.</em><br />
We&rsquo;re not a big company and sometimes we all need to chip in to get the job done. This is the way things happen at a startup. You must be prepared to go beyond your role and appreciate that our nimbleness is actually our greatest strength.</p>
<p>
<em>Energy.</em><br />
We&rsquo;re a pretty flexible employer, but when we do work it needs to be energetic and inspirational to those around us. You need to be hands-on, passionate, persistent, creative and easy to deal with. Ultimately you want to get things done with a high personal productivity.</p>
<p>
<em>Adaptability.</em><br />
Being able to adapt to change when necessary is important for us. As a fast-growing company, we are often changing gears and shifting focus onto new features, goals and priorities. We value those who are able to keep up with those shifts.</p>
<p>
<em>Fun.</em><br />
We want you to enjoy coming to work each day. We&rsquo;ve been known to host some pretty awesome social events - from pirate parties on tall ships to camping trips to wine tastings at local vineyards. If you like to have fun once in awhile, you&rsquo;ll definitely want to consider working for us.</p>
