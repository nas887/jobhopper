	Who We Are</p>
<p>
	Sokanu is a social learning platform aimed at helping people find their passion in&nbsp;life. We believe that people have talents and are passionate about many things, but often don&#39;t know how to translate that passion into a career they love. Sokanu will combine a&nbsp;social networking platform with an adaptive learning engine to provide a unique experience to each user.</p>
<p>

We plan on growing by leaps and bounds, so candidates should thrive in&nbsp;dynamic environments where development is fast and the only constant is change. You&nbsp;should also believe in open platforms and want the development community at large to build off your successes via open standards and API&#39;s.</p>
<p>

	&rArr; RESTful web services APIs for developers, both building &amp; using them<br />
	&rArr; Performance tuning web applications from the frontend to the backend<br />
	&rArr; Scale and what it takes to be successful at a community-driven web site where the&nbsp;word &quot;millions&quot; is used frequently and in many contexts</p>
<p>
	Bonus experience</p>
<p>
	&rArr; HTML, CSS, JavaScript and associated frameworks (jQuery, prototype, YUI)<br />
	&rArr; Artificial Intelligence knowledge, experience with Self-Organizing Maps/Kohonen Networks, Neural Networks, Adaptive Decision-Engines, etc...<br />
	&rArr; Social networking applications and associated design patterns<br />
	&rArr; Abuse and anti-spam approaches and technologies<br />
	&rArr; Ideally, you hold a B.S. or M.S in Computer Science, or have equivalent self-directed&nbsp;study and experience.</p>
<p>
	Also important</p>
