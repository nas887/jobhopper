We look for Python and Django experts with strong production experience who optimize every interaction to be smart and fast.</p>

-Write and maintain elegant code, building out re-usable models and libraries<br />
-Continually improve our production environment<br />
-Design and code features that shape how people experience Storybird<br />

<p>
<strong>Your skills:</strong><br />
-Expertise with Python and Django<br />
-A history of high quality production web apps<br />
-Ability to turn initial designs into functioning features</p>
<p>

-Entrepreneurial mindset (we&#39;re a startup)<br />
-Easy-going personality (team fit is crucial)<br />
-Strong written and verbal communication skills (we value clarity)<br />
-Results focused (you maintain a high signal to noise ratio)</p>
<p>
<strong>Telecommute option</strong>:<br />
This job is open to North American candidates with a preference for Toronto or New York applicants. However, we&#39;ll hire wherever we find the best talent and fit. (The Storybird team is spread over four cities.)</p>
