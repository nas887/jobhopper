Burstly is seeking a technical intern to make an immediate impact with our largest partners. In this role, you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to work with some of the largest app developers on iPhone and Android and assist in the technical implementation of the Burstly SDK into their apps. The ideal candidate has an understanding of the iOS or Android SDK, is a quick learner and problem solver, and has excellent communication skills.</p>
<p>
We are an innovative mobile startup that builds monetization tools for app developers. Our offices are located on the 3rd St Promenade in beachfront Santa Monica, CA. The founders have sold previous startups to MTVN/Viacom and Uproar/ Vivendi Universal. Our team consists of over 15 people and we range from surfers to chess wizards to scotch connoisseurs. We are a hard working team in a non-stop environment that occasionally catches their breath. We are experiencing explosive growth along with our partners, who are some of the premier apps on the iPhone and Android markets. If you ever meet us for an interview and don&#39;t happen to have one of our client&#39;s apps on your phone, we&#39;ll buy you a shot (any liquid of choice).</p>
<p>
Your presence will be felt and you can have an immediate impact on the company. This is not some numbed-down organization where you get anywhere by following an org chart. Beyond internally, you have an opportunity to be a part of the most explosive market of all-time: mobile. We are at the epicenter of this opportunity and it&#39;s ours to lose. You can be front and center as we move at a jaw dropping pace that is unlike anything we have ever seen before. We are tackling a young but massive market that has difficult product, engineering and operational challenges. If you can maneuver tough challenges in fast paced environments, you&#39;ll love it here.</p>

<li>
Managing installation of apps on devices.</li>
