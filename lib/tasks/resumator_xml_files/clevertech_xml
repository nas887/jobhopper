So, it turns out that managing over 25 customer projects, four different potential products, and open source contributions is time-consuming. Who knew? Result is that there is lots of loose ends at Clevertech that need managing.</p>
<p>
A formal set of requirements might include managing the resources across projects. Answer questions like who is available now? And who will be available later? Do we need more designers? Who do we have that is ready to join? Should we do more to attract more talent?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Who are you? You are a generalist. Maybe you have a background as an excel ninja. Perhaps you are a master networker. Build a database in your time? Managed a popular community forum? In any case, you have accomplishments that are valuable.</p>
<p>
Where are you? It doesn&#39;t matter. We operate completely virtually and this is an opportunity for those remote folks who share a US culture but might be located far from any one of us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
What do you love? Growing businesses. Technology. Planning. Organization. Understanding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This is an opportunity to join a succesful growing business. We hit the Inc 5000 fastest growing companies last year and we continue to grow and be a part of the startup revolution that is changing the way we live.</p>
<p>
You may want to read a quora conversation about the operations position http://www.quora.com/Is-it-viable-for-a-young-entrepreneur-to-become-a-COO-of-a-company&nbsp;</p>
<p>
And if you are interested, share an accomplishment where you were the responsible operator and what challenges you faced. Tell me about the most clever technique you use to stay a step ahead. And don&#39;t forget to include your purpose, your why this position works for you.</p>
<p>
