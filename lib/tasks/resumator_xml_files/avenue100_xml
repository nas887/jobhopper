	Built by data driven MIT scientists, our successful start-up company has transformed into becoming one of the major players in the online education space. We need highly motivated, independent thinkers that want to make an impact on the business while not having to wait for a successful exit. Our compensation plans are highly competitive and we prefer short-term incentive compensation based on performance over any unclear or hazy equity package.<br />
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<br />
	Our engineers work with the research, sales, and traffic teams to build solutions to their toughest problems and rapidly deploy tools to keep our business ahead of the competition. Our small teams are solely responsible for their projects. This allows each engineer a high level of independence, ownership and flexibility, but also demands responsible project and resource management.</p>
