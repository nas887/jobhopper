	DailyBurn is one of the market leaders in fitness technology and we are expanding our team. One of the key things that has been a strength of DailyBurn is our graphic/web design and usability. We really care about it here. We care about every pixel, every color, every design element. Since the beginning, our founders would debate small graphic design changes, trying to make sure we have the best user experience possible. Things haven&#39;t changed, we have just got a lot bigger!</p>
<p>
	Our love of design continues as we are building new web apps, new iPhone apps, and in 2011 a new complete product and we need someone to help us make it beautiful and functional.</p>
<p>
	This position will have creative flexibility and will touch a large portion of the DailyBurn brand. While the focus will be on web and mobile front-end design, this position will also design print materials, ads, new products, etc. We see this as a critical part of the team and you will be involved in most product decisions.</p>
<p>
	Specific tasks include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Graphic and user interface design of web components, mobile phone</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Here is what we are looking for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Deep proficiency in Photoshop and other design tools</li>
	<li>
		The ability to build website designs that are very functional, yet extremely beautiful (real world UX design)</li>
	<li>
		The ability to build designs that work well on their respective platforms</li>
	<li>
		The ability to work with a team to iterate and build innovative fitness technologies</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Here is what we don&#39;t want:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Someone who can only build block diagrams and flow charts without making real web front end designs</li>
	<li>
		Someone with a generic CS background with BS like Java and C++ background</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Optional, but great to have:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Experience converting designs into html/css/javascipt</li>
	<li>
		Interest in fitness and health (optional - but hey, we like to work out)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Candidate should be in New York or be willing to relocate. This is a full time gig with benefits, etc. We are a small team of 15, move fast, and love building products.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	If you are interested, we need to see a portfolio. If you don&#39;t have any prior work, we can&#39;t judge if you have the skills. So, please send a link to your portfolio, or samples by email with your resume.&nbsp;</p>
