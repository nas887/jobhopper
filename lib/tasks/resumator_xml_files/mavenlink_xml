	<strong>Web Developer</strong></p>
<p>
	We have a fully funded start-up that is providing consultants, independent professionals, consulting firms, and their clients with the tools they need to get their work done online. Our mission is to make consulting relationships as seamless and easy as working from the office. Our product is in the market and getting attention!</p>
<p>
	Well tested code leads to happy developers! places say that they support pair programming, but we actually do it, nearly 100% of the time means a collaborative, social environment where you are constantly discussing ideas, learning new skills, and sharing your knowledge.&rsquo;ll finish each day feeling impressed with the amount that you and your pair have achieved.</p>
<p>
	The team is committed to business transparency. We&rsquo;re seeking someone who is not only passionate about our technology, but would also be excited to help shape the direction of the company.</p>
<p>

	A very experienced web developer, preferably in Ruby on Rails,<br />
	<u><strong>OR</strong></u><br />
	A strong iOS developer to lead iPhone development,<br />
	<u><strong>OR</strong></u><br />
	A smart programmer from other disciplines who are interested in learning web development.</p>
<p>
	I&#39;m not going to throw down a long laundry list of technologies here.&nbsp; Instead of looking for people who already know specific skills, we look for smart people who will thrive and learn in our social coding environment.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Why you should work with us:</strong></p>
<ul>
