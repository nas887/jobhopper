We have big plans at Agora and we&#39;re looking for Superstar Direct Response Marketers to help us continue our aggressive growth. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
If you have a demonstrated history of success and are ready to take your Marketing career to the next level, this may be the perfect opportunity for you. &nbsp; Agora has a long history of providing an enviornment where Superstars can flourish and be well rewarded. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
In your cover letter, please provide</p>
<p>
1) Specifically which category (only one) you think you can help the most our business<br />
2) Whether you would consider yourself a hungry apprentice, growth based mid-level experience, or a hands-off expert in the category. <strong>All are welcome</strong>, we just need to be clear from the start how to best position you for success.</p>
<p>
Jobs are available to the right candidate in the four categories listed below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Copywriters</strong></p>
<p>
Our copywriting work is near legendary at this point.&nbsp; Anyone heard of the &quot;End of America&quot; promotion?&nbsp; More than 22 million people saw that ad which generated hundreds of thousands of customers.&nbsp; Working in our copy group is a privilege.&nbsp; If you&#39;re coachable, have solid copy skills and want to dramatically expand your income potential, apply today. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Media Buyers</strong></p>
<p>
We buy a lot of media for our offers and we want to buy a lot more.&nbsp; We&#39;re most interested in individuals with at least mid-level experience in buying various types of online media.&nbsp; If you&#39;ve cracked the code in PPC or display media spaces, our offers would give you the potential for unlimited testing and budgets that will make your eyes pop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Business Developers</strong></p>
<p>
We&#39;re often looking for companies to buy or partner with. &nbsp;These deals can be complicated and require saavy, well connected Business Developers. &nbsp;These days it seems like everyone thinks they&#39;re a &quot;Superstar Biz Dev guy&quot;, but that&#39;s just bunk.&nbsp; Most folks simply don&#39;t get it.&nbsp; If you do and want to play in the big leagues, let&#39;s talk.</p>
<p>
<strong>Profit Center Managers</strong></p>
<p>
Profit Center Managers are Revenue Drivers at heart. &nbsp;The right candidate for a PCM position with Agora LOVES Direct Response Marketing. &nbsp; They understand what great copy is and, in a pinch, can produce it themselves. &nbsp;They know how to generate traffic then build out well converting sales and marketing funnels. &nbsp;They know how to put together a good JV deal. &nbsp;Most PCM&#39;s are entrepreneurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Pay will match experience and prospects, but the potential for growth is (No B.S.) unlimited.</p>
<p>
The offices for consideration are likely in Baltimore, MD or Denver, CO. Relocation to work with a great team is almost certainly required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
