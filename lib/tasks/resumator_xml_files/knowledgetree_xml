<strong>Who we are:</strong></p>
<p>
At KnowledgeTree, we&rsquo;re working to allow every business to unlock the value of their content.</p>
<p>
Today, we help customer-facing teams use and improve their best content. Sales people instantly find content that closes deals. Managers identify what collateral works best &ndash; and where gaps are. And marketing improves content to drive more sales.</p>
<p>
Network World called KnowledgeTree one of the 10 SaaS companies to watch; Software AG, Alcatel, Genesys, Fuji Chemical, and 500 other global companies use KnowledgeTree to unlock the value of their collateral.</p>
<p>
We are a growing, agile team with strong opinions. We are creating a culture focussed on building great software, and are passionate about a shared set of values: being smart, focussed, analytical, transparent, humble, and highly effective.</p>
<p>
We are headquartered in leafy, culture-rich, Raleigh, NC. Raleigh has received a litany of Best Places to Live awards from the likes of Forbes, CNN, 24/7 Wall Street, Yahoo Finance, and many others.</p>
<p>
KnowledgeTree is funded by River Cities Capital Funds, Core Capital, Hasso Plattner Ventures, and Hatteras Funds.</p>
<p>
<strong>Who we&rsquo;re looking for:</strong></p>
<p>
We are small, agile team with strong opinions. We are creating a culture focussed on trust, open communication, continuous delivery, automation, monitoring &amp; measuring.&nbsp; We also care about delivering fantastic software.</p>
<p>
We are seeking creative, experienced engineers who live and breath the Dev Ops ethos. We want to hear your ideas, and learn from your experience. You will be fundamental to maturing our operational processes, automating where we have gaps, and monitoring where appropriate. &nbsp;Ensuring that we deliver a rock-steady, scalable service to our customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We use the following to make all this happen: Amazon Web Services (used AWS services include EC2, ELB, SQS, Route 53, S3, EBS, CloudFront, RDS), RightScale, memcached, RabbitMQ, Ruby as superglue, Puppet, LAMP (our app is built on Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), Ubuntu, MySQL clustering, Splunk, New Relic, GitHub, and more.</p>
<p>
<strong>We&#39;d like you to have:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
At least three years of experience with Chef,&nbsp;Puppet, and highly proficient in common coding&nbsp;languages.</li>
<li>
Jenkins / Capistrano experience would be a plus.</li>
<li>
Excellent command line skills on Linux.</li>
<li>
Strong experience with much of the stuff we use to get things done (see above).</li>
<li>
Genuinely passionate about developing software for the purpose of automation, building out highly scalable services, and working with a driven and fun application engineering team.</li>
<li>
Awesome written and spoken communication skills in English.</li>
<li>
Not scared to say &quot;I don&#39;t understand, please teach me.&quot; (or to RTFM)</li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We&#39;re telecommute friendly, and happy for you to be living anywhere in the U.S.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>What we offer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
the (un)usual: great salary, stock, health insurance, 401k, long-term disability, flex-plan accounts</li>
<li>
the extraordinary: great downtown Raleigh location (Helios, bars, eateries, tattoos), free parking, organic snacks, craft beers, fun events, and more</li>

You should be able to turn ideas into extremely fast and reliable code that other people &ndash; or you, six months in the future &ndash; will find wonderfully easy to comprehend and modify.</li>
<li>
You should take pleasure in helping others around you become better developers, and working to make the people around you successful. You should be&nbsp;comfortable saying &quot;I don&#39;t understand, please teach me.&quot; (or&nbsp;RTFM&#39;ing)</li>
<li>
You should be able to write well. You should be able to have healthy conversations.</li>
<li>
You should have ideas when you&#39;re walking around or out with friends or whatever, and then you jot them down and share them with other people.</li>
<li>
You should like good food, and celebrating success by eating together&nbsp;(it&#39;s a big part of our culture);</li>
<li>
You should have had a job or two where things went really right and really wrong. You should have opinions about why this happened.</li>
<li>
You should take great pleasure in creation, momentum, chaos, vibrancy, spontaneity, debate, and silence.</li>
<li>
You should feel comfortable doing things, even when no one is telling you exactly what to do.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If this sounds good, then please do apply.&nbsp;</p>
