<p>Craigslist is big. JumpPost is getting bigger. We’re fascinated by the economics around local supply and demand.  We get off on the 2nd degree of our social graphs.  We believe syndication of content will be followed by syndication of commerce.  Elegant viral mechanisms are rewarded with firm handshakes, and designs that empower a user to share content are held in the highest esteem. We’re just 9 months old, growing, generating cash, working in NYC out of killer loft space on W 13th Street, and having a ton of fun.</p>
<p>Here’s the setup:  Doug rocks the Ruby on Rails, and works across the whole

stack, but let’s just say that he’s no front end Picasso. Jordan loves product, but he thinks in mechanisms and not UI. We build and iterate quickly, and we believe that product and culture drive the company. We need help.</p>

</ul>
<p> </p>
