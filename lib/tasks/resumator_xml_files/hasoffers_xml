<strong>The HasOffers Experience:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">
Our company is full of passionate folks who love to see the impact of their work (whether technical or non-technical). We&#39;re focused yet light-hearted. &nbsp;Intelligent...yet humble. &nbsp;We enjoy the evolutionary process that comes from research, trial, error, research, trail #2 or 3, and success. &nbsp;We constantly look for ways to improve our industry through great software.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">
We respect the tech with 30&quot; monitors, Bose noise-canceling headphones, and a free onsite chef who cooks incredible food with organic and locally sourced ingredients :) &nbsp;<em>You will feel awesome because you eat awesome-ness. &nbsp;We offer great compensation and full benefits.</em></p>
