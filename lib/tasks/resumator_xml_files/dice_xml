	<strong>Art Director &ndash; Easy studio</strong></p>
<p>
	Founded in 2008 by several game and web industry veterans, Easy is a successful new studio focused on free online games. It is the studio group behind Battlefield Heroes, Lord of Ultima, Battleforge and the next-gen shooter Battlefield Play4free. Several other unannounced titles are currently in development. Easy is made up out of 3 distinct teams. A shooter-focused team and web development team both based in Stockholm, and then the German based studio Phenomic which is a strategy game focused studio.<br />
	Easy prides itself on working at the cutting edge of games &ndash; both in development and business models. It has an international audience of millions of players, a multitude of great products live (and in development) AND it is a fun, positive environment to work in with an eye firmly on the future.

	The Art Director is responsible for the visual style and quality of all assets created by the team. This includes in-game and front-end menu assets, web sites and branding. Responsible for the initial high concepts behind visual style, the Art Director communicates their vision by creating key drawings, concept images, mood boards, color swatches, documentation and example assets. The Art Director works with the project&rsquo;s Senior Producer to ensure the art direction fits with the overall project goals and they also work closely with the team&rsquo;s game and web artists to realize this vision.
