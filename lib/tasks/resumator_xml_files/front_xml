	<strong>Why Work at Front?</strong></h3>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	FRONT has been working to build exceptional websites since 2000, so we&rsquo;ve seen the ups and downs, the fads and crazes &ndash; and have survived and grown through them all. How? By listening to our clients and then creating unique and special experiences online for them; the web is our passion, pure and simple. We have a small, diverse team and produce great work for clients from across the UK and Ireland: read more <a href="/about/" title="read more about Front">about the company</a>.</p>
<p>
	We know that creating great web experiences isn&rsquo;t about sticking generic designs on top of the same old code. Every member of the FRONT team knows that understanding our clients and their needs is the only way to create stunning creative and technically robust solutions.</p>
<p>
	<strong>We need people who reflect this ethos</strong> &ndash; people who can combine strong technical and creative skills with a clear passion for the web and an eye for the details. We need developers who care about design, designers who care about code and all the other lovely people in between who can help us create great websites.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Who We&#39;re Looking For?</strong></h3>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We&rsquo;re recruiting for a front-end developer who&rsquo;ll work as part of our team to make great interface design ideas into usable, semantic and accessible websites.&nbsp; The successful candidate will have an excellent knowledge of web standards and the ability to craft beautiful sites that work really well.</p>
<p>
	<em>Salary dependent on experience. Based at our studio in Belfast.</em></p>
<p>
	Douglas Crockford described web browsers as:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		&ldquo;The most hostile software development environment imaginable&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	(As we all know in the case of IE6 this is a vast understatement)</p>
<p>
	Front-end development sits at the intersection of a number of disciplines, including user experience, visual design and development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	These challenges make front-end development particularly difficult.&nbsp; Despite this, launching a site is immensely rewarding.&nbsp; Front-end development has a critical role in making sites widely available, accessible and useful; in providing rich interaction for those browsers that support it; and in producing websites that are stable and dependable.</p>
<p>
	The successful candidate will work as part of our multi-disciplinary team, contributing to the definition of detailed requirements and working collaboratively to realise these.&nbsp; This role already exists within Front and the reason for the vacancy is to expand our capability in this area.</p>
<p>
	The key competencies needed for this role include:</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Developing awesome, standards compliant markup:</strong></h3>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We&rsquo;re looking for someone who has great attention to detail at a code level and an astute understanding of HTML, CSS and javascript, including emerging technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Crafting websites that are fit for purpose:</strong></h3>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We believe that front-end development is more than the art of producing markup to match a graphic design.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re looking for someone who can produce usable, attractive, fast-loading and accessible websites that are easily understood by both people and search engines.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Prototyping:</strong></h3>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We work iteratively, producing working code as quickly as possible to validate our ideas and gather feedback from real users.&nbsp; This role requires the ability to solve technical problems and push the limits of technologies.&nbsp; A basic knowledge of PHP will help with this but server-side development is not the focus of this role.</p>
<p>
	Knowledge and experience with appropriate tools and frameworks is desirable rather than essential.&nbsp; We use off-the-shelf content management tools such as ExpressionEngine, Javascript libraries such as jQuery and CSS frameworks like 960 grid system.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>About Front:</strong></h3>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Front is a web strategy, design and technology studio based in Belfast.&nbsp; We help our clients deliver exceptional experiences to their customers using the web.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve produced culturally relevant and exciting work for organisations like the BBC, Independent News &amp; Media and O2.</p>
<p>
	Every member of the Front team knows that understanding our clients and their customers is the only way to create stunning creative and technically robust solutions and inspiring content.</p>
<p>
	We need people who reflect this ethos &ndash; people who can combine strong technical and creative skills with a clear passion for the web and an eye for detail.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Benefits - the Package</strong></h3>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	At Front you will work with the best people, on the best projects - and be rewarded appropriately. We are with our employees for the long haul, which is why we help to develop and support them in any way we can. We believe that you will love working with us. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Exceptional, challenging work</li>
	<li>
		A great working environment</li>
	<li>
		Competitive salary</li>
	<li>
		Private health insurance</li>
	<li>
		Paid vacation</li>
	<li>
		Professional development</li>
</ul>
