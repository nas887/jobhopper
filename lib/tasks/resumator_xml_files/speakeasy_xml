Speakeasy announces multiple full-time Fulfillment Associate positions available at our fun, well-funded content marketing and social media startup!</p>
<p>
These Associates will assist Account Managers in building clients&#39; brands and increasing online traffic by executing creative strategies across multiple social media platforms.</p>
<p>
We are seeking individuals who can think quickly, enjoy working in a collaborative environment and who can contribute unique ideas. We are looking for people who are not afraid to take a risk and try something new, but will always put the clients&#39; needs first.</p>
<p>
You must be open and willing to work with many different companies crossing over multiple industries.</p>
<p>
We don&#39;t expect perfection, but do expect the Speakeasy team to educate themselves on the best and newest social media practices and tools &ndash; and to share their findings.</p>
<p>
We aren&#39;t looking to hire Jerry Seinfeld, but being funny is a plus.</p>
<p>
Working knowledge of any of the following tools a big plus (though we will train on all):<br />
Hootsuite, Tweetdeck, Google Analytics, Google Adwords, Facebook Advertising, Woobox, Shortstack, Mailchimp.</p>
