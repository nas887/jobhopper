Come use your development skills to change the way small businesses run!</p>
<p>
<strong>About Us</strong></p>
<p>
InsightSquared is a well-funded Cambridge startup. We&#39;re building a simple yet powerful app that helps small businesses make smarter decisions with data from dozens and ultimately hundreds of sources. We help them grow their business and take down their bigger, slower competition.</p>
<p>
We assemble in small product teams that work fast, have fun, and ship often. Your team of engineering, product, and creative peers will drive the operational and strategic decisions needed to move forward.&nbsp;We build on a modern platform (Python/Django). We ship code to production not just daily, but a dozen+ times per day. We test quickly, learn fast, iterate fast, and focus on code that matters.</p>
<p>
Please check out <a href="http://www.insightsquared.com/2012/09/how-we-roll-introduction/">our dev blog</a>&nbsp;to get a feeling for our culture. But don&#39;t trust us when we say we have the best culture in town. InsightSquared was named by Boston Business Journal in the top 25 small company <a href="http://bit.ly/YsWIrv">Best Places to Work in Mass</a>. Drop by Friday after work for a craft brew and try to whip our CTO in ping pong.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<h4>
<strong>In a Nutshell</strong></h4>
<p>
Come throw yourself in the middle of a startup with a get-stuff-done attitude. You&#39;ll help us bridge the gap between the technical details of our software, the nuances of data analysis, and business-minded folks like sales reps and customers. If you&#39;re comfortable with both technology and people, and if it gets your blood flowing to use data analysis to make an impact, then this position is right up your alley.</p>
<h4>
<strong>About Us</strong></h4>
<p>
InsightSquared is a well-funded Cambridge start-up going after a $2.5B market opportunity for data intelligence for small &amp; medium businesses. Several hundred companies have signed on to date as subscribers to our SAAS business reporting software. Our <a href="http://www.insightsquared.com/about/management-team/">management team</a> has previous experience building successful software products at companies like <a href="http://salesforce.com" target="_blank">Salesforce</a>, <a href="http://akamai.com" target="_blank">Akamai</a>, <a href="http://hubspot.com" target="_blank">HubSpot</a>, <a href="http://elance.com" target="_blank">Elance</a>, <a href="http://bzzagent.com">BzzAgent</a>, and <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>.</p>
<h4>
<strong>Job Responsibilities</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
Adapt and explain reports for each customer so that InsightSquared will make a difference in their business, by learning more about their data than they know themselves, digging past their initial requests to understand their underlying needs, and putting all of that together to use InsightSquared&rsquo;s reporting software creatively</li>
<li>
Troubleshoot data that&rsquo;s appearing in an unexpected way and devise a solution that uses the most effective combination of configuration changes, work-arounds, and help from software engineers</li>
<li>
Uncover the aspects of InsightSquared that should be improved, using your perspective as one of the few folks that touch both the technical and non-technical aspects of the customer experience</li>
<li>
Switch smoothly between all the languages of a software company, and know the right times to use each:
<ul>
<li>
The sales team and customers speak in requests, needs, and priorities</li>
<li>
Software engineers speak in product specs, software components, and Agile project management</li>
<li>
The software and database speak in Python and SQL</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<strong><span style="font-size: 1em;">About You</span></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
Personable, clear, and concise communication style via email, on the phone, and in person</li>
<li>
Experience working with data sets in Excel</li>
<li>
Experience not necessary, but a plus: SQL, UNIX, Python</li>
<li>
You have an instinct for organization, even (and especially) when you have many things going on at once</li>
<li>
You&rsquo;re high wattage and hungry to learn more</li>
<li>
You have a great positive attitude and enjoy working with a team of like-minded folks</li>
<li>
Based here in Boston (this is not a remote job)</li>
</ul>
