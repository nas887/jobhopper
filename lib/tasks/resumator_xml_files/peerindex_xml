	<strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>
	You:a &quot;big data&quot; coder who is tired of spinning up instances to calculate the &ldquo;Most Read Article&rdquo; from log files. You have the experience and ability to process huge amounts of data, and is interested in building a model for predicting who are the most influential people online. You enjoy working on problems that include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		processing billions of facts from the social web, identifying conversations and their topics</li>
	<li>
		harvesting and analysing terabytes of data harvested from the social web to identify user interests and influencers by applying elegant maths that you and your buddies designed.</li>
	<li>
		arguing with your others on how important a retweet is over a +1 on Google+</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Who Are We?</strong><br />
	We are PeerIndex (www.peerindex.com) a company based at the heart of Silicon Roundabout leading the way to help companies and individuals understand and capitalise on the impact of their social influence on the web and off.</p>
<p>
	We are changing the face of social engagement and authority - we are about giving individuals ownership over their influence and the value of their data - and we are looking for people to join us in this adventure.</p>
<p>
	We are expanding our Data Engineering team - building an environment where the most creative of people can explore and build upon some of the largest data sets in the world -- elegantly creating meaning out of the social web.</p>
<p>
	Our team is bold and brilliant and are looking for like-minded people. And we are about changing the world - not about punching the clock.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Who Are You?</strong><br />
	You are a graduate in computer science or of similar experiences (not all education happens in unis); has had previous experience in crunching through large data sets using tools like Hadoop or Mahout; and can argue the finer points of why Java is a better language than PHP or Python for &ldquo;big data&rdquo; efforts or vice versa.</p>
<p>
	You are about holding your own in a software architecture discussion and can sense when the solution presented is not the right way forward.</p>
<p>
	You are likely a closet maths geek (yes, you were calculating the odds of Spain winning the World Cup) - but your true calling is the ability to develop elegant code alongside other amazing people.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What About the Role?</strong><br />
	You will be responsible for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Developing systems for identifying, evaluating and predicting influence in online and offline spheres</li>
	<li>
		Working closely with data scientists to build, implement and operationalize (at a large scale) algorithms to describe influence and contagion in networks</li>
	<li>
		Working as part of the wider development team across our data platform</li>
</ul>
<p>
	We think our influence algorithms will take on the greater challenge - building the PageRank of People. Sure, you could go to Google, or you could be involved with the development and execution of a novel and groundbreaking service.</p>
<p>
	You will be a member of the Data Science Team working with others to test out models and use agile development techniques to improve and enhance with live data. You will work with the Product Team to bring your algorithm to light so that your mum might understand what you are working on and why Uncle Bob is an authority in Cheshire Cheese.</p>
<p>
	And you might add to the Apache Hadoop project - helping to grow the ecosystem that is &ldquo;big data&rdquo;.</p>
<p>
	While we are currently based at London&#39;s Old Street tech quarter, our organization is distributed over five time zones so we are also willing to speak with exceptional remotely located applicants.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What Must I Have?</strong><br />
	At the very minimum, you must be able to work in the EU. Please - do not apply if you do not already have a valid work permit for the EU (unless you are from the US and then you could apply since our CTO is an American).</p>
<p>
	Additionally you must have:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Excellent experience in coding &ldquo;big data&rdquo; solutions - with an emphasis in Hadoop / Mahoot solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Since we are doing some heavy analysis, you should have experience in two of the following four disciplines:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Graph analysis: main social network analysis methods (such as calculating centralities, graph partitioning, community detection, modelling contagion)</li>
	<li>
		Data analysis: large scale data analysis and experience with machine learning techniques</li>
	<li>
		Natural language: natural language processing, text retrieval, web search, search of social networks</li>
	<li>
		Web Search: you know what we mean</li>
</ul>
<p>
	To hold your own, you should have more than a year of experience in data analysis</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Oh, and having experience in Hadoop (or Nutch or Mahout) and Java is a major point.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Can I Get Bonus Points?</strong><br />
	Sure - we would love it if you have an affection and experience in some of the functional languages that are making a splash (like Erlang and Scala). We also would like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		A Computer Science or similar quantitative degree is desired - but some of the best developers are self-taught autodidacts</li>
	<li>
		Familiarity with C++, Python</li>
	<li>
		Experience in predictive modelling gained in a commercial-oriented technology business</li>
	<li>
		That you enjoy discussing the differences between the BrownCoats and the Empire.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Okay - so how much do I make?</strong><br />
	Well, we would be telling if we told you the salary right off the bat. But you can be sure that pay is commiserate with experience and effort. And you will participate in the ownership of the company though our options package and other potential benefits.</p>
<p>
	So if your idea of fun is spinning up 20 cloud-based servers and pulling down gigabytes of data to process through Mongo and Hadoop, then we&#39;d really like to hear from you. Around here, we call that - a &#39;Wednesday&#39;.&nbsp;</p>

	<strong>Introduction</strong><br />
	You: a PHP guru who is sick of getting the call for &ldquo;yet another website&rdquo; that is more of brochure-ware and marketing glitz. You have been itching to build a solid Symfony2 solution which will serve billions of API requests per day and serve customers from around the world - all on the order of millisecond response times. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Heck, you might even be excited to build your own applications to earn some extra dosh on the side. You are looking at problems like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		handling the mashing up of &quot;big data&quot; and the characteristics of it for regular customers and global brands to better understand their influence</li>
	<li>
		architecting&nbsp;a service oriented architecture (SOA)&nbsp;solution that handles the response rate of a widely-used API on the order of milliseconds</li>
	<li>
		making the architecture flexible enough for proper A/B testing on interface to develop more gamelike features (see the buzz word &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">gamification</a>&quot; - we want it better...)</li>
	<li>
		why companies use API management solution like Mashery and/or Apigee</li>
	<li>
		why the Symfony2&nbsp;framework is a hell of a lot better than Zend, Nuke or Cake (PHP 5.3)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Who Are We?</strong><br />
	We are PeerIndex (<a href="http://www.peerindex.com">www.peerindex.com</a>), a company based at the heart of Silicon Roundabout leading the way to help companies and individuals understand and capitalise on the impact of their social influence on the web and off.</p>
<p>
	We are changing the face of social engagement and authority - we are about giving individuals ownership over their influence and the value of their data - and we are looking for people to join us in this adventure.</p>
<p>
	We are expanding our front end team to support our growing number of users of our API as well as building out applications to allow people to better understand this &ldquo;social influence&rdquo; thing we do.</p>
<p>
	Our team is bold and brilliant and are looking for like-minded people. And we are about changing the world - not about punching the clock.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Who Are You?</strong><br />
	You are a graduate in computer science or a similar quantitative degree (our CTO is partial to EE or ME) and (hopefully) had previous experience in developing amazing applications for users to better understand data. While the role could be simply revamping the existing PHP codebase, we have bigger things in store.</p>
<p>
	Rather than have you simply draft PHP code, you will spend your time learning and growing the entire interface layer - from the datastore to the application widgets to the front-end - all via a high-performing REST API layer.</p>
<p>
	And you are one of those PHP guys (gender non-specific) who knows the strengths and weaknesses of different frameworks and is not afraid to argue the finer points of Symfony2. But when you defend your position, you have proof from your own code or experiences, not just opinions formed from reading Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>
	You are about holding your own in a software architecture discussion and can sense when the solution presented is not the right way forward.</p>
<p>
	You might be a closet maths geek (yes, you were calculating the odds of Spain winning the Women&rsquo;s World Cup) - but your true calling is the ability to develop elegant code alongside some amazing people.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What About the Role?</strong><br />
	We have numerous responsibilities in the PHP Engineer role since no one person will be placed in one small role for the time. You could be responsible for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Developing in Symfony2 and Twig templates for our consumer-facing&nbsp;and client-facing interfaces</li>
	<li>
		Building the PeerIndex REST API which powers all requesters to the PeerIndex SOA</li>
	<li>
		Architecting and extending API services for those web applications that are dependent upon the PI data</li>
	<li>
		Working as part of the wider development team across our data platform</li>
</ul>
<p>
	We like to think that our influence algorithms will take on the greater challenge - think of it as building the PageRank of People. Sure, you could go to Google,&nbsp;or you could be involved with the development and execution of a novel and groundbreaking service.</p>
<p>
	You will be a member of the PeerIndex Development Team bringing about a better way of controlling and accessing people&rsquo;s own &ldquo;social capital&rdquo;.</p>
<p>
	And you spend some of your &quot;copious spare time&quot; adding to various OSS projects to help grow those projects.</p>
<p>
	While we are currently based at London&#39;s Old Street tech quarter, our organization is distributed over five time zones so we are also willing to speak with exceptional remotely located applicants.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What Must I Have?</strong><br />
	At the very minimum, you must be able to work in the EU. Please - do not apply if you do not already have a valid work permit for the EU (unless you are from the US and then you could apply since our CTO is an American).</p>
<p>
	Additionally you must have:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Significant experience in developing solid PHP frameworks in an &ldquo;agile&rdquo; style - be able to work with the business side and be an advocate for both the technical issues and the customer issues</li>
	<li>
		Experience with Symfony2 or other similar MVC frameworks</li>
	<li>
		Expert at object-oriented programming concepts and design patterns</li>
	<li>
		Portfolio and code samples showing work that demonstrates OO PHP programming</li>
</ul>
<p>
	You probably have strong experiences in:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		DVCS such as git or mercurial</li>
	<li>
		Unit testing and Continuous Integration</li>
	<li>
		Service-oriented architectures, web services, and Cloud technologies</li>
	<li>
		PHP 5.3 and all the new shiny stuff that comes with it (e.g., namespaces, closures, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Can I Get Bonus Points?</strong><br />
	Sure - we would love it if you have an affection and experience in some of the functional languages that are making a splash (like Erlang and Scala). We also would like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		A Computer Science or similar quantitative degree is desired - but some of the best developers are self-taught autodidacts</li>
	<li>
		Experience in predictive modelling gained in a commercial-oriented technology business</li>
	<li>
		...and why you can install 16GB into the newest MacBook Pros and you know DAMN well how you are going to use it</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Okay - so how much do I make?</strong><br />
	Well, we would be telling if we told you the salary right off the bat. But you can be sure that pay is commensurate with your experience and effort. And yes, you will have ownership in the company through our options package and other potential benefits.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How Do I Apply?</strong><br />
	Simple: fill in the questions to the right and submit your cover letter (something brief), your CV and (more importantly) - point us to your personal blog, your GitHub and/or SO profile, any meetups that you attend, and/or any OSS projects you contribute to or mashups you have built. You choose what we should look at.</p>
<p>
	So if your idea of fun is turning around a user interface component and seeing it deployed with your new features in less than a day, then we&#39;d really like to hear from you. Around here, we call that - a &#39;Tuesday&#39;.&nbsp;</p>

	You: a Javascript &quot;ninja&quot; (yeah, we hate saying it) who is sick of getting the call for &ldquo;yet another website&rdquo; that is more of brochure-ware and marketing glitz. You have been itching to prove that MVC works ont he front-end as well. &nbsp;You&#39;d love to create engaging interactions using HTML5/CSS3 solutions that run on the better browsers, iPads, mobile devices - so &nbsp;your friends and family can understand what it is you do beyond &ldquo;my son/daughter makes the Internet&rdquo;.</p>
<p>
	Heck, you might even be excited to <a href="http://burakkanber.com/balldeformation.html">build your own gaming applications</a> to earn some extra dosh on the side. You are looking at problems like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		how to use protovis to make compelling visual presentations and allow a user to understand their own actions/interactions</li>
	<li>
		how to leverage HTML5/CSS3 extensions to make a website that is configuable on all platforms with elegance and scalability</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Who Are We?</strong><br />
	We are PeerIndex (<a href="http://www.peerindex.com">www.peerindex.com</a>), a company based at the heart of Silicon Roundabout leading the way to help companies and individuals understand and capitalise on the impact of their social influence on the web and off.</p>
<p>
	We are changing the face of social engagement and authority - we are about giving individuals ownership over their influence and the value of their data - and we are looking for people to join us in this adventure.</p>
<p>
	We are expanding our front end team to support our growing number of users of our API as well as building out applications to allow people to better understand this &ldquo;social influence&rdquo; thing we do.</p>
<p>
	Our team is bold and brilliant and are looking for like-minded people. And we are about changing the world - not about punching the clock.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Who Are You?</strong><br />
	You are a graduate in computer science or a similar quantitative degree (our CTO is partial to EE or ME) and (hopefully) had previous experience in developing amazing applications for users to better understand data. While the role could be simply editing our Symfony2 templates, we have bigger things in store.</p>
<p>
	You will spend your time learning and growing the entire interface layer - building wdigets and front-end interactions - all via our flexible REST API layer.</p>
<p>
	And you are one of those Javascript/HTML guys (gender non-specific) who knows the strengths and weaknesses of different frameworks like dojo and jQuery. But when you defend your position, you have proof from your own &nbsp;experiences, not just opinions formed from reading Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>
	You are about holding your own in a software architecture discussion and can sense when the solution presented is not the right way forward.</p>
<p>
	You might be a closet maths geek (yes, you were calculating the odds of Spain winning the Women&rsquo;s World Cup) - but your true calling is the ability to develop elegant code alongside some amazing people.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What About the Role?</strong><br />
	We have numerous responsibilities in the PHP Engineer role since no one person will be placed in one small role for the time. You could be responsible for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Developing in jQuery and/or backbone for our consumer-facing&nbsp;and client-facing interfaces</li>
	<li>
		Working with the&nbsp;PeerIndex REST API team to improve the offerings for our internal and external customers</li>
	<li>
		Designing and developing new interfaces for creating microsites, report generation, etc.</li>
	<li>
		Working as part of the wider development team across our data platform</li>
</ul>
<p>
	We like to think that our influence algorithms will take on the greater challenge - think of it as building the PageRank of People. Sure, you could go to Google,&nbsp;or you could be involved with the development and execution of a novel and groundbreaking service.</p>
<p>
	You will be a member of the PeerIndex Development Team bringing about a better way of controlling and accessing people&rsquo;s own &ldquo;social capital&rdquo;.</p>
<p>
	And you spend some of your &quot;copious spare time&quot; adding to various OSS projects (like jQuery) to help grow those projects.</p>
<p>
	While we are currently based at London&#39;s Old Street tech quarter, our organization is distributed over five time zones so we are also willing to speak with exceptional remotely located applicants.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What Must I Have?</strong><br />
	At the very minimum, you must be able to work in the EU. Please - do not apply if you do not already have a valid work permit for the EU (unless you are from the US and then you could apply since our CTO is an American).</p>
<p>
	Additionally you must have:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Significant experience in developing&nbsp;in an &ldquo;agile&rdquo; style - be able to work with the business side and be an advocate for both the technical issues and the customer issues</li>
	<li>
		Strong experience with Javascript frameworks (e.g., jQuery, dojo, backbone, node.js)</li>
	<li>
		Solid, clean front-end code in HTML5 and CSS3</li>
	<li>
		Portfolio and code samples showing work that demonstrates your&nbsp;programming skills</li>
</ul>
<p>
	You probably have experiences in:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		DVCS such as git or mercurial</li>
	<li>
		Unit testing and Continuous Integration</li>
	<li>
		Building well-structured, modular Javascript applications</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Can I Get Bonus Points?</strong><br />
	Sure - we would love it if you have an affection and experience in some of the functional languages that are making a splash (like Erlang and Scala). We also would like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		A Computer Science or similar quantitative degree is desired - but some of the best developers are self-taught autodidacts</li>
	<li>
		Experience in predictive modelling gained in a commercial-oriented technology business</li>
	<li>
		...and why you can install 16GB into the newest MacBook Pros and you know DAMN well how you are going to use it</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Okay - so how much do I make?</strong><br />
	Well, we would be telling if we told you the salary right off the bat. But you can be sure that pay is commensurate with your experience and effort. And yes, you will have ownership in the company through our options package and other potential benefits.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How Do I Apply?</strong><br />
	Simple: fill in the questions to the right and submit your cover letter (something brief), your CV and (more importantly) - point us to your personal blog, your GitHub and/or SO profile, any meetups that you attend, and/or any OSS projects you contribute to or mashups you have built. You choose what we should look at.</p>
<p>
	So if your idea of fun is turning around a user interface component and seeing it deployed with your new features in less than a day, then we&#39;d really like to hear from you. Around here, we call that - a &#39;Tuesday&#39;.&nbsp;</p>
