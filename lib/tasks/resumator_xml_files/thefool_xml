Really.<br />He/she will engage with systems, play with Tb of data on Amazon's S3,<br />with a few million hits daily, with a pain-in-the-ass CEO who can code<br />and is convinced to be a skilled programmer. With a few billion records<br />schedules in his database. Used for queries, of course... in realtime.<br />HE/she should have fun, like we do, and get pissed by searching the<br />damned solution demanded by the situation. We need an enthisast,<br />otherwise he/she couldn't be of the crew.<br /><br />We don't need a CODE MONKEY, we need a CODE POET.<br /><br />We're in need of:<br /></pre>
<ul>
<li>user experience / interaction design prowess</li>
<li>javascript coding experience (ideally with extjs, jquery or other fashionable frameworks)</li>
<li>rails, php, sinatra or python experience (whatever works, with not-so-slight preference for RoR)</li>
<li>basic SQL skills (can write queries with joins)</li>
<li>deep (DEEP) engagement in writing secure code and grasp to security concepts</li>
</ul>
<pre><br />...the kind of person whoâ€™d be a 1-person engineering department for a 2-person web company.<br /><br />If you think you can fit, please notify us :) </pre>]]></description>
