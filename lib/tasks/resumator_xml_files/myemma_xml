Emma is looking for a Developer to join our growing engineering team.</p>
<p>
We&#39;re looking for someone with a proven track record of building robust, scalable platforms with an eye to finding elegant solutions to complicated problems.</p>

<li>
You know Python or similar high-level language. You write code that others want to read. Your commit log is a thing of beauty. You dream in closures.</li>
<li>
You have strong technical and architecture skills. You&#39;re as comfortable sketching the 50,000 ft view as you are tuning the tiniest of details, and you&#39;re adept at turning conceptual designs into shippable code.</li>
<li>
You understand a variety of data technologies, both relational and non. You&#39;ll know the strengths of each, and when to use them.</li>
<li>
You are analytical, inquisitive, and energetic &mdash; with a bias toward proactive communication, collaboration and action.</li>
</ul>

Applications should be accompanied by a cover letter and code sample.&nbsp;We are looking for folks who would like to live and work in Nashville, TN or Portland, OR.</p>
