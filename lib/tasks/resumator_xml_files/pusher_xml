			<description><![CDATA[<p>We make hard problems simple, and aim to free developers from operating and maintaining their own realtime infrastructure.</p><p>The current Pusher product is a multi-tenant distributed system that allows our customers to deliver billions of messages to their connected users. We operate at massive scale, and this informs and affects everything we do.</p><p>Our engineering team is based in London. We are looking for engineers who will thrive working in a challenging environment on interesting problems. We aim for developer autonomy, and work with a modified Kanban process. Our engineering team is also heavily involved in operations, so you need to know how to deploy, monitor and maintain a large production system.</p><p>We are demanding about who we hire, and look for personal qualities as much as experience.</p><p>Requirements</p><ul><li>You show perseverance in the face of tough challenges</li><li>You can explore uncertain territory and create innovative solutions</li><li>You are constantly curious about new technology</li><li>You are pragmatic where necessary, but a perfectionist where it counts</li></ul><p><br />In terms of practical experience, it helps if you&#39;ve worked on distributed systems in the past, or have fulfilled a sysadmin/ops role. You should have experience programming in an evented style in multiple languages and frameworks.</p>]]></description>
