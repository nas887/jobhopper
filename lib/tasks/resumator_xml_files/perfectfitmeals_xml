	We are a youthful new healthy food service distribution company on the west side of Houston looking for a very nice, fun, energetic administrative/accounting assistant with customer service and bookkeeping experience</p>
<p>
	A little about what we do and who we are:</p>
<p>
	We produce healthy pre-packaged meals that we sell to our customers and we create our product selections at the request of the customers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our team is comprised of active and energetic people who are interested in healthy lifestyles and healthy eating choices.</p>
<p>
	What we are looking for:</p>
<p>
	Our new team member will be responsible for processing invoices for A/P which includes coding line-items to various expense accounts. Attention to detail is imperative.&nbsp; You will also be responsible for tracking receipts and reconciling them with the end of month statements, so great organization is also a must.&nbsp; Because our company is part of a larger organization, there will also be the opportunity to provide support to our other companies, such as backing up the receptionist as needed and assisting with other projects as they arise.&nbsp; Our ideal person would have 4 to 8 years of varied experience, be able to leap tall buildings and outrun speeding bullets, as well as have the ability to laugh off messed-up people.</p>
<p>
	Kidding aside, we are looking for a &ldquo;good person,&rdquo; family oriented, not much on pierced parts or a face full of tattoos.&nbsp; Our new team member will be able to pass a drug screen and a criminal background check.<br />
	The target salary for this position is $30,000/year with full benefits.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve even been known to give increases and bonuses to people who contribute and don&rsquo;t cause a bunch of drama.</p>
<p>
	To be considered for the position, please submit your <em><strong>resume AND a cover letter</strong></em>.&nbsp; In your cover letter, include a paragraph that tells me who you are as a person and where you&rsquo;re going in this life and another paragraph that explains what you&rsquo;ve learned from your previous work experience.</p>
<p>
	Have fun with the cover letter&mdash;don&rsquo;t take it too seriously.&nbsp; No one at our company bites.&nbsp; We just want to know more about our newest team member!</p>
