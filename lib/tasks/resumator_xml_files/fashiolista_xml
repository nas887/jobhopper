<p>
Both devops and development at Fashiolista use Python and work closely together. You will be working in a team of experienced developers.

<li>
Designing new systems in collaboration with the dev team</li>
<li>
Take part in a 24/7 on-call rota</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Who we are looking for</strong><br />
We&rsquo;re looking for someone with strong analytical skills and focus on automation. You need to understand the full web stack and how the components fit together.
