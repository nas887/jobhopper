Samasource is an award-winning technology social enterprise that provides dignified, internet-based work to people living in poverty. We build technology that helps leverage the brain power of the poor so they can lift themselves out of poverty by providing valuable services to companies around the world. Our technology platform takes large data projects for leading enterprise clients like LinkedIn and Google, and breaks them into smaller tasks called &ldquo;microwork&rdquo; which are completed by our workers.<br />
We are a dynamic and growing team, committed to changing the world with an innovative business model and game-changing technology. We&rsquo;ve got a big vision - to connect the one billion people living in poverty around the world to work - and need the best and brightest to help us achieve it.

<strong>The Team:</strong><br />
As a social business, we are passionate about alleviating poverty while creating happy clients. Team D (for Delivery) plays a big role in achieving the Samasource vision. We partner with clients to design a comprehensive plan for each project, and work closely with our delivery centers to ensure high quality execution. We are laser-focused on client satisfaction because satisfied clients mean more business, and more business means more workers can pull themselves out of poverty.

2. GTD: We have created a culture of getting things done. We avoid recklessness but at the same time we are proactive, follow through on what we start and do not fear experimentation.<br />
3. Transparency: We aim for everything we do to pass the New York Times Test.<br />
4. Team Work: We encourage input from all levels of our organization and in return expect people at all levels of our team to be able to execute on these ideas.<br />
5. Social Mission First: We always consider the good we can do before we think about income, PR or success for ourselves. Finding work for the people who need it most is what drives us.<br />
6. Innovation: Good technology is at the core of our value proposition to the workers we serve. We respond quickly to new market opportunities.<br />
7. Equality and Respect: Sama means equal. Everyone deserves the chance to succeed. We don&rsquo;t accept limits and we maintain a sense of humility in dealing with our people, our workers, and our supporters.</p>
