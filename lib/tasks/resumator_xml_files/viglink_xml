<h5>
	About You</h5>

		<b>You work for startups.</b> Not as an aspiration but as a way of life.</li>
	<li>
		You can communicate the good work you&#39;ve done to us and to the other <b>rockstars</b> you&#39;ll be recruiting in your first week.</li>

<h3>
	About VigLink</h3>
<p>
	VigLink is the pioneer and market leader in automated affiliate marketing. We offer web publishers large and small a suite of technologies to drive incremental non-advertising revenue from existing content with zero ongoing time investment and little to no impact on their site. We are looking for highly talented, motivated and visionary people who want to build something great that defines an industry. We&#39;re building a high-volume, low-margin system focused on revenue and performance, operating in real-time and at web-scale. We currently handle more than 3.5B pageviews a month and 2M clicks a day through our network and we&#39;re just getting started.</p>
<p>
	The company has been funded by <a href="http://www.google.com/ventures/">Google Ventures</a>, <a href="http://www.firstround.com/">First Round Capital</a> and some <a href="/about#angels">stellar angels</a> including Reid Hoffman, but the team is young and small enough that we are still giving out meaningful equity. You will have a substantial role in defining what the company is, does and feels like.</p>
