<strong>How to apply</strong><br />
We ask all applicants to submit your resume, cover letter (tell us a bit about yourself), and portfolio or send us a mini shoot so we can evaluate your skills as a community photographer.</p>
<p>
<br />
<strong>What&rsquo;s a Mini Shoot?</strong><br />
For photographers who have little to no experience photographing real estate, we ask that you do a simple mini shoot to show off your skills. Please submit 10-15 photos showing off a property (examples: your home, family home, friend&rsquo;s home, ect&hellip;) Images should be shot as if you were marketing the property for rental or sale and include both interior and exterior shots. Images can be uploaded in a zip folder or PDF file.</p>
<p>

<strong>*APPLICANTS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED IF THEY DO NOT HAVE A PORTFOLIO(OR MINI SHOOT)</strong></p>
<p>
<br />
<strong>** This is a contract position and our photographers are paid per assignment. Please use the &quot;Desired Salary&quot; field to let us know your desired per shoot rate.</strong></p>
