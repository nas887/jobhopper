	<strong>About Scout Advertising</strong></p>
<p>
	Scout Advertising helps advertisers reach consumers within 100 meters of any location. Our technology is based on true location and real-time context across billions of monthly impressions.</p>
<p>
	Our Hyper-Local Situational Targeting has helped advertisers, including dozens of recognized brands, secure click-through rates four times higher than the industry average and equally high conversion rates.</p>
<p>
	We have a killer team (Amazon, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, CMU, Waterloo), an awesome history (including the incredible growth of ThinkNear), and even some buzz (Business Insider, TechCrunch, GigaOm, Mashable...).</p>
<p>
	We are tackling hard and interesting technical challenges, creating massive opportunity, and having a ton of fun in the process. We&rsquo;re always looking for ambitious, driven self-starters who want to be on the leading edge of developing technology.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Role</strong></p>
<p>
	We are looking for a top tier software engineer or chronically under-recognized hacker. Along the top of your resume, you could list 30-odd acronyms from SQL to XML and back through the JVM a dozen times, but hate the idea that that&rsquo;s what companies will evaluate you on. You don&rsquo;t code, you craft. Your solutions are as elegant as they are simple. You love getting that perfect solution that takes only 4 lines of code instead of an ungodly 6. You have experience building real products in the real world.</p>
<p>
	Our ideal candidate can self-manage. When a critical deadline looms you can power through and deliver a reliable solution. You are the go-to guy (or girl) on whatever team you work. You are ready to jump into an intense and high-growth start-up environment.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Qualifications</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Bachelors Degree in Computer Science or related major from top school</li>
	<li>
		Good CS fundamentals</li>
	<li>
		Experience developing in Xnix (Mac good if you use the command line a lot)</li>
	<li>
		Comfortable in a small, intense and high-growth start-up environment</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Perks</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Competitive comp package</li>
	<li>
		Daily Halo &amp; ping pong tournaments</li>
	<li>
		Lots of snacks, drinks, and other goodies in the office</li>
</ul>
