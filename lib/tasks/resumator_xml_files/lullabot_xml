<strong>About Lullabot</strong></p>
<p>
Lullabot is a distributed company with flexible hours, but we tend to schedule meetings and expect employees to be on-line and available during a North American workday. Our current team is spread out across North America and Europe.&nbsp;Lullabot&#39;s past clients include Sony Music, FastCompany, The Grammys, MTV UK, O&#39;Reilly Media, Lifetime Television, and many more.</p>
<p>
Working for Lullabot is probably unlike anything you&rsquo;ve done before. To slightly paraphrase Voltaire (and Stan Lee!), &ldquo;With great freedom comes great responsibility.&rdquo; At Lullabot, you get to (generally) make your own hours and work from home or wherever you like. Self-direction, a casual but confident attitude, and a focus on quality over quantity are some of the things we look for. We work from both the head and the heart and guide our decisions by our <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/values">Core Values</a>.</p>

Don&#39;t see an appropriate job on our jobs page, but still want to reach out and introduce yourself? This is why we&#39;ve created the &quot;other&quot; job post. We&#39;d like to meet you too.</p>
<p>
Lullabot is a talent agency. We&#39;re always looking for passionate, talented, and quick-witted people to help us do awesome things. We&#39;re known for being down-to-earth, trustworthy, hardworking, creative, friendly, and deeply knowledgeable. Most of employees work from home, yet we have a tightly-knit team which works very closely together despite geographical separation.</p>
<p>
More than anything, we&#39;re driven by wanting to do interesting and challenging work &ndash; and to do it well. This has taken us in many unexpected and exciting directions over the years. We&#39;ve grown the scope of our <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/what-we-do">services</a>; we&#39;ve built several products; we&#39;ve worked on some amazing projects with some amazing <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/work">clients</a>; and we&#39;ve been happy to learn and explore. We never quite know where the future is going to take us. Think you&#39;d like to be part of our future? Introduce yourself.</p>
<p>
One thing that we say is that &quot;we tend to hire more for the person than the position.&quot; Although we often have specific resource needs, we try to find talented and driven people who are a match for Lullabot&#39;s culture. Often if we can find the right people, we&#39;ll spend some time to figure out how to incorporate them into our work.</p>
<p>
Even though we may not have a specific position posted, we&#39;re always on the lookout for great designers, marketing people, front-end and back-end developers, mobile developers, project managers, content and community strategists, sales and account management people, and even business development, accounting, administrative staff, and &quot;others&quot;. What do you do? Think you&#39;ve got a talent that we should be interested in? Get on our radar!</p>
<p>
<strong>Some things to know before you apply:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Take a look at our <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/values">core values</a>. They act as our guiding principals and are very important to us. If they don&#39;t resonate with you, you might not be a good match for Lullabot.</li>
<li>
With a few exceptions, most &#39;bots end up doing a lot of traveling. You okay with at least one week of travel every 2 months?</li>
<li>
As a distributed company, we require excellent communicators. You&#39;ll need to have excellent verbal and written skills.</li>
<li>
We also need self-starters who are good at managing their own tasks and time. There is no such thing as micromanagement at a distributed company. No one will be looking over your shoulder. It&#39;ll be up to you to get your work done and communicated about it effectively.</li>
<li>
You&#39;ll find that most of the &#39;bots are pretty quick-witted with a good sense of humor. We can do some high pressure work and the ability to maintain optimism and laugh it off can be a necessity.</li>
<li>
We ask people to create a 2 minute video to submit with their application. Since we don&#39;t tend to do in-person interviews, this is a great way to &quot;meet you&quot; and has become an essential part of our hiring process. We realize that most people are a bit nervous and self-conscious recording a video of themselves and we certainly take that into account. It does&#39;t need to be high production value either. You can take a video with your smartphone and put it on YouTube (usually unlisted) or Vimeo (usually password protected). Your resume and cover letter will tell us about your work experience. Use the video to tell us about yourself. The video is not required, but we watch and appreciate every video submitted. It is *very rare* for us to hire anyone who hasn&#39;t submitted a video and whom we don&#39;t already know. Here are the video applications from several of the bots who were hired: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC4pL193fVw">Seth</a>, <a href="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1771736/Video/James%20Sansbury.m4v">James</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/26632559">Joe</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/60512806">Olanda</a>, <a href="http://www.godbolt.me/lullabot/">Micah</a>. Have fun with it!</li>

<strong>Technical Project Manager</strong></p>
<p>
<br />
Have that rare combination of technical acumen and the ability to lead teams, make decisions, and get things done? We&rsquo;d love to talk to you about managing projects for Lullabot! Lullabot makes hyper-aesthetic, epic-scale web projects successful for companies like Martha Stewart, NBC Universal, Turner Broadcasting, The Recording Academy, Intel, and the Pac12, and that&rsquo;s just our work over the last 6 months. Projects of this magnitude require a competent hand on the tiller&mdash;someone technical enough to understand the intricacies of large-scale Drupal web projects, but also someone that can see the big picture, translating business goals into requirements, specs into estimates and tickets, and talented individuals into teams. With that in mind, Lullabot is hiring an experienced technical project manager.</p>
<p>
Responsibilities include: writing requirements as specifications, user stories, or tickets; and managing scope, deliverables, schedules, and team resources for Lullabot client and internal projects. Daily tasks include leading daily 15 minute check-in calls for each project, scheduling and leading periodic sprint reviews and planning meetings, tending the ticket queue and managing task lists, communicating (email/phone) with clients, performing rigorous testing and verification, and keeping projects on track and moving forward. In addition, we believe a great project manager should have experience doing the work that they&#39;re managing. Experience as a front-end or Drupal developer is a huge plus. &nbsp;Lullabot is a distributed company without a central office, so like all Lullabot jobs, this is a telecommuting position that occasionally involves travel.</p>
<p>
Additional responsibilities include helping to write and assemble new project proposals and statements of work, estimating and staffing projects, meeting with clients, pursuing and growing development partnerships, and coordinating project launches.</p>
<p>
If this sounds like a lot, it is. But Lullabot is a very collaborative company so you won&#39;t be working in isolation. You&#39;ll be working with a team of highly experienced Drupal consultants and developers with excellent communication skills and a passion for their work.</p>
<p>
<strong>Ideal candidates should:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Have 2 years or more experience managing or participating on large-scale Drupal projects.</li>
<li>
Have experience managing projects in ticketing systems such as Github, Assembla, JIRA, or Unfuddle.</li>
<li>
Understand code promotion workflows, version control, and development best practices.</li>
<li>
Be a great communicator with good writing skills.</li>
<li>
Be comfortable managing and organizing remote virtual teams.</li>
<li>
Be based in the U.S.</li>
<li>
Have a great sense of humor!</li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Availability: </strong>Ideally, we&rsquo;d like to hire a full-time resource, but we&rsquo;re open to accomplished contractors as well.</p>
<p>
<strong>Apply:&nbsp;</strong>We&#39;re asking applicants to submit a 2-minute video introducing themselves. We realize that for many people this is an exercise in self-consciousness, however, being a distributed company, it helps us quickly get to know you. Just shoot something with your computer&#39;s webcam and post it as a password-protected video on Vimeo. You can post your video elsewhere, or get more fancy with it if you like, but we&#39;re really just looking for a brief introduction. Take a look at one of these videos to see what&#39;s gotten folks hired in the past.</p>
<br />
<p>
<strong>About Lullabot:</strong>Lullabot is a small Drupal-oriented consulting, training, and development company which has provided technical architecture, guided development, and helped launch many of Drupal&#39;s top sites including those by The Grammys, Martha Stewart, Sony Music, IBM, O&#39;Reilly Media, Lifetime Television, Fast Company, MTV UK, Harvard University, Walmart, the BBC, Verizon, the Washington Post, and more.</p>
