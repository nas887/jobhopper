We are seeking a visual design intern to work part-time in an unpaid position with Deeplocal. The intern is expected to be proficient with standard tools such as illustrator and photoshop and to have a solid understanding of color, typography, and design standards. The timing of this position is negotiable but applicants are expected to be able to commit to a minimum of 3 months and a minimum of 2 days per week. We are looking for someone to help with the design and lay-out of creative decks, but there will be opportunities to be involved in creative branstorming and other design project work as well.</p>
<p>
This internship will be an opportunity to build upon your design experience as well as show us why you&rsquo;d be a great fit for full-time employment in the future. We&rsquo;ve worked with a few awesome interns in the past, and we&rsquo;re looking to hire another. Working at Deeplocal is challenging but a lot of fun; we&rsquo;re a tight group without any attitudes or arrogance. We have a summer kickball team, the occasional retreat,&nbsp; and internal classes to improve our skills.</p>
<p>
Our ideal candidate will not have another full-time job and will have a flexible schedule. There is potential for a great candidate to be brought on full-time, but applicants should be prepared for the job to be a temporary summer internship position ending in the fall. Candidates should currently live in the Pittsburgh area.</p>
<p>
To be considered for this position, it is required that you provide a link to your online portfolio.</p>
<p>
Working at Deeplocal<br />
Deeplocal is a small boutique innovation studio based in Pittsburgh. We work on great projects with fast timelines and each employee must be highly driven, passionate about what they do, and able to multi-task. Our clients include American Eagle Outfitters and Reebok, and we also work with large advertising agencies like Wieden + Kennedy, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Ogilvy. Please apply but don&rsquo;t be upset with us if we don&rsquo;t write you back. We are pretty busy and you may not be right for the job. We appreciate your interest in Deeplocal.</p>
