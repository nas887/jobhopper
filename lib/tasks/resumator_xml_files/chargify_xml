	<strong>About Chargify</strong></p>
<p>
	Chargify is a recurring billing application developed by Grasshopper Labs, a team of entrepreneurs, developers, and marketers who strive to create breakthrough web apps. Grasshopper Labs was founded by the same team behind Grasshopper.com, a highly successful subscription-based virtual phone system that has served millions of entrepreneurs over the last six years.</p>
<p>
	The sheer number of today&rsquo;s subscription-based applications demanded a smart billing system built on years of experience. Unfortunately, the market was filled with clunky, off-the-shelf systems that fell short, and enterprise solutions that charged huge set up and transaction fees. Finally, we thought: Why not just build an intelligent billing application system ourselves? After all, billing thousands of customers a month through Grasshopper taught us everything there is to know about billing. So, we put our years of knowledge to good use, and Chargify was born.</p>
<p>
	Chargify&rsquo;s affordable freemium pricing has no long-term contract, and no transaction or overage fees. We provide a robust set of business intelligence, fraud management, and dunning management tools to help you retain more customers, and ultimately grow your business.</p>
