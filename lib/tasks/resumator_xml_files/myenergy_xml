	<li>
		Not afraid to make a design decision when no design is present.</li>

<p>
	We&#39;re building the consumer side of the universal energy internet on Rails, and we&#39;re looking for multiskilled engineers that are equally comfortable getting their metaphorical fingers deep in the code, their virtual fingers floating in the cloud, and their physical fingers dirty in a laptop upgrade. You&#39;ll collaborate with all members of our development and product staff in building consumer facing web infrastructure, publishers and consumers of web APIs, and evolving a fast changing development environment. Working atop datasets never before accessed and assembled in the same place, you&#39;ll build experiences and interactions that make a difference here at home and the world over. We&#39;re looking for folks who are versatile and comfortable on all sides of a sophisticated web application, who aren&#39;t fazed by the difficult and who envision and execute on concepts never before possible.</p>

		Development: Like to code? Over half of our staff contributes to our code base, and you&#39;ll have a range of interesting opportunities to show your chops.</li>
	<li>
		Energy Efficiency: Build a product that can have an impact on climate change &amp; the future of energy.</li>
	<li>
		User Growth: Create a clear and impactful signup experience that drives us toward many millions of users.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Your Job Duties</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Depoly and Maintain multiple Heroku and AWS applications under the direct supervision of the VP Engineering</li>
	<li>
		Develop and extend Rails applications for data import</li>
	<li>
		Collaborate with entire engineering team on system architecture and development practices</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Why MyEnergy?</strong></p>
