Here at ShipCompliant, we hold a couple beliefs close to our hearts. We believe that work and play can be the same thing when you love your job. We believe that good guys don&rsquo;t finish last &ndash; and that integrity, authenticity, and empathy <em>are</em> the bottom line. We believe that people are more important than strategy; and that with the right people on board, anything&rsquo;s possible. Oh, and we believe in <strong>having fun</strong>, preferably while drinking wine.</p>
<p>
<br />
We&rsquo;re ShipCompliant, and we&rsquo;re more than a software company. We&rsquo;re a movement, and we&rsquo;re revolutionizing an industry by making it easier for wineries, distillers, and wine &amp; spirits importers to share their products with their customers. We&rsquo;re also one of Colorado&#39;s leading web companies named to <strong>2011 Colorado Companies to Watch</strong> and the <strong>Mercury 100 Fastest Growing Startups 2008, 2009, 2010 &amp; 2011</strong>.</p>
<p>
<br />
As the industry leader in wine compliance software, we&rsquo;ve got an enthusiastic - and rapidly growing - customer base. We need an exceptional Client Services Specialist to help provide insanely great customer service to a set of world-class winery managers, owners, and winemakers.</p>
<p>
<br />
The <strong>Client Services Specialist role isn&rsquo;t your typical customer service gig</strong>, and you&rsquo;re not a typical customer service rep. Your stellar communication skills span various media: face to face, email, phone, whiteboard, napkin, etc. You&rsquo;re a great listener with the maturity to recognize business critical situations and ask for help when you need it. You&rsquo;re obsessed with learning new things, and have been known to stay up all night reading about stuff that interests you. You have a college degree - whether it&rsquo;s in Comparative Literature or Zoology &ndash; and can back up your smarts with proof (i.e. transcripts). You&rsquo;re a whiz with Excel, and ideally have some experience with project management tools like MS Project or BaseCamp.</p>
<p>
Most importantly, you&rsquo;re ambitious and eager to launch your career at a company where <strong>opportunities for growth and development</strong> abound.</p>
<p>
<br />
Still with us? Read on!</p>
<p>
<br />
As a Client Services Specialist, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Learn our software inside and out so you can provide fanatical phone and email support to customers. (We provide training, but you&rsquo;ll be expected to pick it up quickly.)</li>
<li>
Use your unmatched &ldquo;can-do&rdquo; attitude and exceptional problem-solving skills to analyze, resolve, and escalate customer questions and concerns.</li>
<li>
Become a Salesforce ninja (our account management software) to not only maintain customer accounts, but also schedule product tours, update content, and communicate with the team.</li>
<li>
Act as the voice of our customers to our product team to ensure problems are solved to completion.</li>
<li>
Identify ways to enhance and improve our products; from initial design through testing and delivery.</li>
<li>
Help with electronic newsletters, informational videos, webinars, training sessions and more.</li>
<li>
Become a seamless member of our Client Services team, working alongside some of the smartest and most passionate people you&rsquo;ll ever meet.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
Think you have what it takes? Do you thrive in a fast-paced, challenging, team-oriented environment? Do you enjoy being paid a competitive entry-level salary plus great benefits and fun perks (like an annual company trip to Napa)? Ok, that last one is a no-brainer.</p>
<p>
<br />
If you meet the above qualifications and this sounds like a great fit, we can&rsquo;t wait to meet you. <strong>Please apply directly through</strong>: http://www.shipcompliant.com/careers</p>
