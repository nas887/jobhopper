	<strong>WARBY PARKER</strong><br />
	<strong>Position Description: </strong>Operations Associate</p>
<p>
	Warby Parker was founded with a rebellious spirit and a lofty objective: to create boutique-quality, classically crafted eyewear at a revolutionary price point. Prescription eyewear simply should not cost $300+. By cutting out the middlemen and engaging directly with consumers through our website (www.warbyparker.com), Warby Parker is able to offer vintage-inspired frames custom fit with anti-reflective, polycarbonate prescription lenses- all for $95 including shipping. Additionally, we enable customers to share the gift of vision. For every pair of glasses bought, we donate a pair to someone in need.</p>
<p>
	We launched the company 10 months ago and have been extremely excited and flattered by the demand for our eyewear. We have been featured in publications such as GQ, Vogue, Oprah, NY Times, Forbes, and Daily Candy, and were named one of Entrepreneur Magazine&rsquo;s &ldquo;100 Brilliant Ideas of 2010&rdquo;. We now have tens of thousands of customers and are looking to ramp up our all-star team to meet that demand by hiring a talented, dynamic and energetic person to be an Operations Associate.</p>
<p>
	You will initially be focused on operations &amp; customer service, working closely with the founders to help us run the company and provide an amazing experience to each and every customer. Over time we hope you will have the opportunity move into a broader role, take on increased responsibility and grow professionally along with Warby Parker.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Description of Initial Role: </strong>We want to provide our customers with an extraordinary shopping and ownership experience. To that end, we must carefully and effectively, process and fulfill customer orders and treat our customers exceptionally. You will be at the forefront of that effort:</p>
<p>
	&bull; You will be on the front lines with our customers, acting as the voice of Warby Parker and providing &ldquo;knock-your-socks-off&rdquo; customer service, answering customer calls and emails, and helping to solve customer problems<br />
	&bull; You will work closely with our optical lab to confirm customer prescriptions and ensure that customers receive their eyewear in a timely manner.<br />
	&bull; You will be asked to constantly think of ways to improve customer service and operations protocols to prevent repeat problems and make our team more efficient<br />
	&bull; You will manage returns and help us understand why customers returned their products.<br />
	&bull; You will help us to further develop our order fulfillment processes and integrate operations with key vendors<br />
	&bull; You will follow up with customers after a sale to ensure that they love their eyewear.<br />
	&bull; You will become the company expert on our internal management system and actively track sales orders, inventory and customer relationships.<br />
	&bull; You will be asked to get involved in other areas of the business based on your interest and company needs&mdash;this could be anything from writing posts for our upcoming blog to helping manage our supply chain to setting up a pop-up retail shop</p>
<p>
	<br />
	<strong>Potential Growth Opportunities: </strong>We are a startup and expect there to be compelling future growth opportunities for you in a number of areas. You will be one of our first team members and have great opportunities to evolve into a leader in many different functions. Your future involvement in these areas will depend on your performance and interest and our needs.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Ideal Candidate:</strong> You are razor sharp, extremely creative, will take lots initiative, are exceptionally well organized, self motivated and passionate about building an organization from scratch. You are charismatic and instantly likeable to a wide variety of people, driven by a high degree of extroversion, and a balanced mix of self-confidence and humility. You&rsquo;ve graduated from a top college and have repeatedly proven yourself academically and professionally. You have relevant experience mixed with a fresh perspective and entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Commitment: </strong>This is a full time position.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Location:</strong> You&rsquo;ll work out of our NY headquarters in Union Square.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Compensation: </strong>We will compensate you at competitive startup rates. We also provide a comprehensive benefits package, including health insurance, cell phone and gym reimbursement for full time employees.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How to apply:</strong> To apply please respond to this posting with the following information and please title your email: &ldquo;Operations Associate R&rdquo;. Please note that incomplete applications will not be considered.</p>
<p>
	1) A copy of your resume</p>
<p>
	2) A few words on why you&rsquo;d like to work for Warby Parker and why the Operations Associate role is right for you</p>
<p>
	3) Answers to the following customer inquiries &ndash; please pretend that you are a Warby Parker Operations Associate writing to a customer (hint you will find some helpful information on our website)</p>
<p>
	a. I want a square pair of black frames that I could wear to work or out at night. I think I have a pretty normal sized head. What pairs would you recommend for me and why?</p>
<p>
	b. I need to return both glasses I purchased. Love the glasses, the prescription just doesn&#39;t feel right. What should I do next?</p>
<p>
	c. I bought glasses and tried to return them. I have waited a week for a return shipping label and have not received one. I initially wanted to exchange the glasses, but, at this point it would be better for me to return the glasses for a refund. I don&#39;t like having the matter left open for so long.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	Thank you very much. We appreciate your interest in Warby Parker and look forward to the potential of working together.&nbsp;</p>
