<strong>About Shoefitr:</strong></p>
<p>
Shoefitr helps online shoe shoppers find the best-fitting shoe. Our application asks a shopper what shoe and size she currently wears, compares it to the shoe she wants to buy, and recommends the best-fitting size. We accomplish this with a database of internal shoe measurements acquired using 3D scanning technology.</p>
<p>
Our customers include TOMS, New Balance, and Heels.com. You may have read about us in TechCrunch, Time Magazine, or Runner&#39;s World. We&#39;re venture-backed and growing rapidly. We&#39;re hot. And we&#39;re looking for a talented front-end engineer to help us shape the future of Internet apparel retail.</p>
<p>
<strong>About the position:</strong></p>
<p>
You will join a talented engineering and design team that has worked on everything from Microsoft&#39;s C++ compiler, to the Linux TCP implementation, to high frequency trading algorithms. We think you&#39;ll learn a lot from us, and we look forward to learning a lot from you.</p>
<p>
You&#39;ll work with us to build out our product offering for footwear and apparel retailers. This will involve working with our designers to make UX decisions, prototyping experimental features, and building reusable Javascript components to simplify development. We expect you to be a &quot;full-stack&quot; programmer, but most of your time will be spent developing the user-facing pieces. We have openings for this position in both our Pittsburgh and San Francisco offices (sorry, no telecommuting).</p>
<p>
<strong>About you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
BS in Computer Science or equivalent experience.</li>
<li>
Mastery of Javascript, HTML and CSS. Experience with other dynamically-typed languages a plus.</li>
