	Nomadesk is a small, fun, cool place to work (just come check us out and you won&rsquo;t be sorry).&nbsp; We like to dream about the future of file sharing and cloud computing &ndash; and we need another &ldquo;A player&rdquo; to join our growing team of star developers. In short, we want the best.</p>
<p>
	You will be joining a small, growing development team in Austin, TX. A team that is given the environment they need to maximize productivity.&nbsp; (This team reports directly to the SVP Product and Technology.)</p>
<p>
	If you join Nomadesk as a PHP Developer, this is what you get to do:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Take a leadership role in the future architecture of our back-end server side components and API system as we add new features requiring changes to our core &ldquo;controller&rdquo;.</li>
	<li>
		Contribute to the ongoing maintenance of the server side components of the Nomadesk solution.</li>
	<li>
		Work with other PHP Developers in both Austin and Belgium to develop the new generation of Nomadesk products.</li>
	<li>
		Take on development tasks with both front-end web development and back-end server side components.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	If you are the successful candidate, you will have this background:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		7-10 years of experience as a PHP developer</li>
	<li>
		Experience architecting back-end server side components that include a set of APIs used by both internal systems and 3rd party developers</li>
	<li>
		Experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript</li>
	<li>
		Experience using PHP for both web development and for developing backend server side components</li>
	<li>
		Experience working in an agile development environment</li>
	<li>
		Proven track record in estimating development tasks and meeting those estimates</li>
	<li>
		Experience using Linux development environments</li>
	<li>
		Experience using an MVC framework (i.e, Cake, Zend, Symfony)</li>
	<li>
		Experience with either GIT or SVN</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<br />
	Stuff that would be nice to have, but not necessary to do the job:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		.NET development experience</li>
	<li>
		Knowledge of how to use jQuery</li>
</ul>
