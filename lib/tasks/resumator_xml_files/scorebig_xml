This is a great opportunity for somebody who wants to get in on the action of a well-funded, fast-growing company in their 4th (and so far best) year of doing business. We are looking for talent to help us take the company to the next level in the live entertainment industry.</p>
<p>
We have an opening for an entry-level position ideally suited to a new graduate who perhaps doesn&#39;t have a lot of work experience, but is smart, hardworking, and eager to join a team environment. This position has historically been a stepping stone to more responsibilities if you earn them. We are looking for somebody who wants to get in and grow with the company. As a Data Specialist you will be doing Internet research, learning how to run projects, and honing all sorts of skills that you can apply to your career. Speed, accuracy, and problem-solving skills are very critical to this position, as is the endurance for repetitive work too. Most important is working gracefully in a team of specialists with deadlines to hit.</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re someone who&#39;s detail oriented and loves solving problems, then you&#39;d fit in well here. This is such a big part of the job, in fact, that before we see your resume, we have a few questions for you. If the idea of doing this sounds unappealing, then you probably aren&#39;t a good fit for the position. Also: we delete any resumes right away that don&#39;t answer the questions, so you would be wasting your time if you just attach a resume and send.</p>
<p>
1. What is the price for a ticket to New York&#39;s production of Book of Mormon in row B of the Center Mezzanine on October 1? Bonus points for Orchestra Row A.</p>
<p>
2. How many rows are in Plaza Infield 222 for the Oakland A&#39;s home venue?</p>
<p>
3. What was your favorite live-entertainment experience in 2012-13? In a concise paragraph, please elaborate why.</p>
<p>
Explain, in detail, your workflow in coming up with answers for these questions, except for #3.</p>
<p>
Here are the basic requirements we have for all new hires:<br />
. Smart<br />
. Detail oriented<br />
. Excellent command of written and spoken English<br />
. Takes initiative<br />
. Hard working<br />
. Easy to work with</p>
<p>
Ideal Candidate:<br />
. Bachelors degree<br />
. Internet savvy<br />
. High sports IQ (you know who teams and players are in all the major leagues and attend games)<br />
. High concert IQ (you know which bands are popular and go to shows)<br />
. High theater IQ (you know what tours are going around and what&#39;s the success or flop of the Broadway season)</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Contact us: Send cover letter, answers to questions, and resume in either attachments or email. Please indicate that you actually read this, if it seems like mostly a copy/paste job, I doubt I&#39;ll read it.</p>
<p>
Any emails received that do not follow the simple instructions above will be ignored.</p>
<p>
This is a fulltime, onsite position. Please no freelancers, agencies or contractors&nbsp;</p>
