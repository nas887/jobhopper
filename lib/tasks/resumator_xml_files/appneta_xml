Are you comfortable working from the database to the DOM?</p>
<p>
Our technology monitors the full stack, so we like engineers who can work across all its layers. You&#39;ll join our small, agile team and work to build smarter end-to-end web app performance monitoring.</p>
<p>
Our stack is a typical &quot;big data&quot; system: we have a data faucet and processing pipeline that does a ton of writes (Cassandra, Hadoop, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Python, C/C++), a backend that does a ton of reads (Python), and a powerful interface (Backbone, D3, jQuery). We use it to analyze and visualize the performance of web applications.</p>
<p>
We work on elegantly answering questions about performance that web developers face each day. Our work is distributed, agile, and test-driven. We&#39;re based in Boston, MA, with an office in Providence, RI. If you&#39;d like to join our team, please get in touch!</p>

At AppNeta, we strive to provide an elegant and powerful interface for exploring mountains of web application performance data. Summarizing and visualizing it all is a big challenge, and we&#39;re looking for a front-end engineer to help us develop new charts, visualizations, and features.</p>
<p>
We&#39;re looking for someone who is as passionate as we are about building clean interfaces (with Backbone, jQuery, LESS, HTML5) and cool charts and graphs (D3, Protovis, SVG). If you can dig into the backend occasionally (Python), or are interested in building your backend chops, that&#39;s great too. You&#39;ll join our small, agile team and work to build smarter end-to-end web app performance monitoring.</p>
