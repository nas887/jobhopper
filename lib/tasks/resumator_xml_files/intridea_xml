<strong>Seeking Ruby on Rails developers for both remote and onsite (in NYC or DC) positions.</strong></p>
<p>
Intridea is a recognized industry leader in Rails development, and our team is growing. From helping startup clients launch the latest and greatest products, to designing and building apps for companies like Bank of America, Geico, WhitePages, and Amazon - we&#39;re working on great projects for exciting clients. We have a very talented team of designers and developers who are great at what they do, and we&rsquo;re looking to expand our team.</p>
<p>
We&#39;re looking for hard-working, enthusiastic, and talented developers who have real-world experience developing Rails applications. Applicants should be knowledgeable about both front-end and the back-end development, be curious about latest developments in the web space, and enjoy working with clients to tailor solutions for their needs. We also look favorably on strong open source contributions - please include your github id.</p>
<p>
Among the jumble of skills and tools it would be nice for you to know: Ruby, Rails, Rspec, HTML, CSS, SASS, jquery, MySQL, MongoDB, node.js, git, caching, API development, browser compatibility, database tuning, and all the other buzzwords you see in Rails job postings. &nbsp;Extra points for previous team / project management experience.</p>
<p>
Travel may be required for some project assignments, though many projects can be worked from your home office. Right now we&#39;re especially looking for developers that can work &nbsp;onsite in Washington, DC or New York City, as well as remote developers. We offer a great benefits package including a good salary, health insurance paid by the company, 401K with matching, birthdays off, and Amazon Prime for all employees!&nbsp;</p>

* Are you a quick study that tends to get bored after three to six months on the same project?<br />
* Like the startup atmosphere, but think it would be nice to learn from more than just a handful of engineers?<br />
* Do you find yourself working on side projects as a way to learn new technologies?<br />
* Wish you could get exposed to a variety of businesses across different industries?<br />
*Do you want to have a real impact solving big problems for some of the best known brands in the world? And also have the opportunity to help build products for cutting-edge startups?</p>
<p>
If any of the above is true then you should consider working at Intridea. Working at Intridea means:</p>
<p>
* Working on an exciting new project every three to six months.<br />
* Working for some of the worlds best known brands solving real business problems.<br />
* Helping startups build and launch products.<br />
* Having the support of 50+ world class designers, engineers, and leaders to make you look good and help you grow.<br />
* Constantly learning new technologies and keeping your skills sharp.<br />
* Never being bored.</p>
<p>
A year at Intridea is equivalent of 5 years at other startups. In a year at Intridea you&#39;ll build two to three products and applications from beginning to end. You&#39;ll learn multiple sets of technologies and you&#39;ll work with several amazing teams. That&#39;s in just one year. Are you ready for the challenge?</p>
<p>
Many of our alumni have gone on to start their own companies, work at organizations like Twitter and Github, or become CTO&#39;s and CIO&#39;s of other startups. How do you want to spend the next few years of your life? Becoming an expert in a narrow set of technologies toiling away at a single application? Or grow like you&#39;ve never done before?</p>
<p>
We&#39;re currently looking for top notch Ruby developers in DC. Backbone.js or other Javascript framework experience is a plus.</p>
