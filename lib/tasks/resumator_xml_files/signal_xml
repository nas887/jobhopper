	Signal is at the forefront of digital communications, delivering simplified solutions for marketers to successfully engage customers across channels. We leverage mobile, social and email technologies to deliver deep customer insights to marketers who can then target communications to individual needs, making every digital interaction between marketer and consumer genuine and compelling. Recent growth has created the need for a Community Manager to drive many of our copywriting, social engagement, thought leadership and product education efforts.</p>
<p>
	<strong>You, in a nutshell</strong><br />
	You are a technophile who uses a number of digital communication channels daily, both on the web and on your phone. Beyond your personal use, you understand how these emerging forms of digital communications can enhance the dialogue between brands and consumers. You appreciate receiving a text coupon from your dry cleaner right before you&rsquo;re about to bring in that week&rsquo;s laundry. You follow your favorite apparel brand on Twitter because they always let you know what exclusive events are coming to the store down the street. You open every email from the travel site you use because they know exactly what trips you want to take and when.<br />
	You feel most at home when your sleeves are rolled up and your hands are dirty in developing killer best practices, talking to customers via tweet, comment or blog post or leading a product demo via webinar. You take intense pride in your background and skills as a writer of web-friendly copy. You&rsquo;re excited by the opportunity to join a young, fast-growing company. You thrive in a dynamic, fast-moving and constantly evolving culture.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What You&#39;ll Do</strong><br />
	As a key member of Signal&#39;s product marketing team, you will be the primary force behind our social outreach initiatives and authorship of key marketing tactics aimed at general market education (whitepapers, best practices, blogging, webinars etc) and product education (FAQs, video demos, etc).<br />
	Other key responsibilities include:<br />
	&bull; Write. You will be the lead copywriter for Signal&#39;s website, blog and education materials. You will not only need to be proligic, but also maintain a consistent &quot;human,&quot; jargon-free tone that embodies the Signal brand. Writing is a huge part of this gig. Come prepared with samples that highlight your skills.<br />
	&bull; Teach. Create content to help people understand the benefits of a well-executed cross-channel digital marketing program. Educate all marketers, from small business owner to Fortune 500 VP, on how they can best take advantage of mobile, social &amp; email marketing via tactics like whitepapers, how-to guides, best practice documents, video interviews &amp; demos, webinars, etc.<br />
	&bull; Help. Teaching&#39;s BFF. You will support current and potential customers in understanding the nuts and bolts of Signal. Whether by tweet, video demo, instructional webinar or FAQ, you will translate product specs into a clear handbook on how to map our product to customer success.<br />
	&bull; Pitch-in. The product &amp; marketing team at Signal is lean (but not at all mean). From time to time, you may be asked to help out on other projects to help define and market our product. We promise they will be awesome.<br />
	&bull; Measure. You will develop goals and metrics for our social engagement &amp; education efforts and translate those into reports and dashboards for evaluating success so that the breadth of Team Signal can see the spoils of your efforts. Ensuring you keep an eye on competitors&#39; efforts in these areas is assumed.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Qualifications &amp; Work Experience</strong><br />
	&bull; BA/BS<br />
	&bull; Incredible writing skills, preferably honed through experience as a copywriter, journalist, editor or marketing communications manager<br />
	&bull; You are not a &quot;social media expert&quot; or &quot;guru&quot; and understand why that&#39;s a good thing. You are active enough on a number of social platforms to understand how to engage communities of people there in a professional context. You probably have created a community or two yourself and may have experience as the voice of a company/brand.<br />
	&bull; Web &amp; social analytics are not a foreign language to you. You can go deeper than visits, fans &amp; followers to uncover metrics that tell the story of customer engagement and conversion.<br />
	&bull; Some knowledge of HTML, Expression Engine (CMS) and Wordpress would be a big plus.<br />
	&bull; Persistence that stops just short of nuisance. You can motivate people in a cross-functional team or organization to give you the time, insights &amp; materials needed to be successful.<br />
	&bull; Passionate about Social Media, Mobile Marketing, SaaS business models and web technology platforms<br />
	&bull; You like working hard and thrive in a start-up environment. Even better - you&#39;ve worked at a start-up or mid-stage company before<br />
	&bull; High energy for digital marketing and promoting our products externally &amp; internally</p>
<p>
	<strong>Benefits</strong><br />
	&bull; Competitive salary based on experience<br />
	&bull; Medical and dental insurance<br />
	&bull; 401(k)<br />
	&bull; Transit pre-tax enrollment<br />
	&bull; Flexible vacation policy</p>
<p>
	<strong>Perks</strong><br />
	&bull; Laptop of choice (except anything running Windows), big monitor, etc<br />
	&bull; Free iPhone! (or phone of choice)<br />
	&bull; Team lunch every Friday, frequent team outings</p>
<p>
	<strong>Location</strong><br />
	&bull; Signal&#39;s HQ is Chicago, but for the right candidate we&#39;d be open to remote employment.</p>
<p>
	<br />
