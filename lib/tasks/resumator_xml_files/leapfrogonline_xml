Leapfrog Online is looking for highly organized candidates for an <strong>Agile Delivery Manager </strong>opportunity.&nbsp; We develop complex web apps using popular frameworks like Django and Rails, and we need people to organize and streamline the development process.&nbsp; Are you a good communicator who can do some translation from Marketing Speak into Technology Speak?&nbsp; Are you attentive to detail and able to juggle a lot of priorities and responsibilities?&nbsp; Are you a critical thinker who&rsquo;s able to learn new skills and apply them in clever ways to the job at hand?&nbsp; If so, we&rsquo;re looking for you!</p>
<p>
<strong>What we are looking for is a &ldquo;Delivery Manager&rdquo;, but what is that?</strong><br />
What we need are people who will manage teams in an Agile software development environment using Kanban and Scrum.&nbsp; An Agile Delivery Manager focuses in these four areas &ndash; Team Management, Project Management, Coaching, and Continuous Improvement.&nbsp;&nbsp; As an Agile Delivery Manager, you will utilize appropriate tools and techniques to manage a cross-functional team.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll work with almost everyone in the company &ndash; Media, Marketing, Creative, Engineering, Contact Centers, and our clients &ndash; to help deliver successful online marketing programs for our diverse Fortune 500 clients.<br />
<br />
<strong>What kind of person are we looking for?</strong><br />
At Leapfrog Online, our Delivery Management team embodies the spirit of servant leadership.&nbsp; Our Delivery Managers give priority attention to the needs of their team members and those they serve first.&nbsp; We are looking for humble stewards that will help advance our company&rsquo;s growth through their commitment to the needs of their teammates.&nbsp; Delivery Managers work tirelessly behind the scenes &ndash; to help remove the obstacles that are impeding progress and do whatever it takes to make their teams as successful as possible.<br />
<br />
<strong>What will you do every day?</strong><br />
You will organize and facilitate project meetings including daily stand-up meetings, sprint reviews, estimations, retrospectives, and sprint planning meetings.&nbsp; You will collect objective and subjective feedback through Agile practices such as burn down charts, velocity tracking, and retrospectives.&nbsp; Then, you will use this feedback to interpret trends to promote continuous improvement.&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll get to work with business team members to understand the vision, objectives, and intended ROI behind the enhancements, initiatives, and platforms being proposed for development.&nbsp; In order to help the team complete these tasks, you will develop and maintain team standards, tools, and best practices, facilitate discussion and conflict resolution, and you&rsquo;ll empower the team to self-organize.<br />
<br />
So if this sounds good to you, you might be wondering who we&rsquo;re looking for.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re searching for a college graduate with experience managing agile software development projects.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;re looking for someone that has experience with Scrum and/or Kanban.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re looking for someone with demonstrated experience in online marketing, software development, business process analysis, requirements gathering, or project management.&nbsp; If you have experience with website or e-commerce application development, that is a huge plus.&nbsp; Keys to success include being highly organized and attentive to detail, possessing excellent written and verbal communication skills and being highly self-motivated and resourceful.&nbsp; If you are comfortable working within a fast-paced and dynamic environment and have the ability to prioritize and perform multiple tasks in time critical situations, you are the person for us.<br />
<br />
<strong>Who are we?</strong><br />
Leapfrog Online is the leading independent digital direct marketing firm in the country, developing programs for Fortune 500 marketers to find and convert the right customers.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re not your average marketing company, though.&nbsp; We stake our business directly on the success of our products, our Clients&rsquo; business results, and ultimately, their satisfaction.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re a small company, and to feel at-home here, you need to thrive in a fast-paced environment, be self-motivated and a resourceful independent-thinker who works well in a collaborative team environment.&nbsp; Leapfrog is committed to agile project management and the open-source software movement.<br />
<br />
<strong>Still interested?</strong><br />
If so, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in it for you: a competitive salary plus an incentive and benefits package; a close-knit team who likes what they do and has fun doing it; and, if that&rsquo;s not enough, there&rsquo;s free all-you-can-drink soda, and free bagels on Fridays.</p>
