<p><a href="http://www.backtype.com/" target="_blank">BackType</a> is a social media analytics company founded in June, 2008.    We develop products that help companies understand their social impact.</p>
<p>We're a small team (<a href="http://twitter.com/golda" target="_blank">Chris</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/nathanmarz" target="_blank">Nathan</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/michaelmontano">Mike</a>), who love building great   products and pushing code every single day. By leveraging technologies   like EC2, Clojure, Thrift and Hadoop to the fullest extent we're able  to  test new ideas and ship new products faster than teams ten times our   size. Also, unlike most companies, we don't just talk the talk when it  comes to open-source. Not only is BackType built on open-source  software, but we're also very active contributors:</p>

<p>We believe in creating an environment that attracts a rare type of     person — the type of person that wants to change the world and takes a     radically different approach to responsibility. We don’t believe in     managing each other or have BS meetings: the best ideas and solutions  win, regardless of    seniority. Working with us means you’ll have a  significant impact on the    way we think, what we make, and where we  go. We’re committed to bringing together    amazing people to do amazing  things, and we work tirelessly to pursue    our goals.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Requirements</span></p>

<p>BackType is a social media analytics company founded in June, 2008.  We develop products that help companies understand their social impact.</p>
<p>We believe in creating an environment that attracts a rare type of   person — the type of person that wants to change the world and takes a   radically different approach to responsibility. We don’t believe in   managing each other: the best ideas and solutions win, regardless of   seniority. If you work with us, you’ll have a significant impact on the   way we think, what we make, and where we go. We’re bringing together   amazing people to do amazing things, and we work tirelessly to pursue   our goals.</p>
<p>We're obsessed with learning about our customers and creating  incredibly beautiful and useful products. By using tools like Clojure,  Thrift, and Hadoop, we're able to ship products and test new ideas  several times a week,  rather than every few months.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering what it’s like to work for a fast growing,   venture funded start-up in Silicon Valley, this is the opportunity for   you.</p>

<li>You're a hacker that gets things done: a real doer, not just a   thinker</li>

<li>You're someone who loves picking up new languages and technologies</li>

<p>We're not really interested in reading standard cover letters.   Instead, tell us why you to work at an early stage  start-up rather than  a large incumbent like Google or Microsoft.
