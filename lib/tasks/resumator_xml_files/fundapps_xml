FundApps is all about simplicity. We&rsquo;re fed up with clunky installed software, manual testing and years between releases. We also think that clients are too! We believe in simplicity, automation and testing &ndash; that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re bringing the benefits of cloud based software, agile development and simpler user interfaces to the finance industry. Like the sound of us? Why not come and work for us?</p>
<p>
<strong>Join our growing development team building great technology and solving challenging problems.</strong></p>
<p>
Being the sort of person who is multi-talented you won&rsquo;t be afraid of getting your teeth stuck into the full range of software development including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Big architectural decisions down to front-end UI tweaks</li>
<li>
Back-end messaging processing with RabbitMQ through to AngularJS and selenium testing</li>
<li>
Establishing best practices</li>
<li>
Evaluating new technologies</li>
<li>
Helping us build FundApps team as we grow</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>You</strong></p>
<p>
We love enthusiasm. So, if you have it by the bucketload then read on.</p>
<p>
Ideally you are someone who actively looks at new technologies in your spare time. The perfect candidate would bring some experience in .NET &amp; JavaScript but actively dip into other areas. Hopefully, our technology stack reads to you like a list of familiar friends, finger crossed you&rsquo;ve already spotted things we haven&rsquo;t mentioned and should&rsquo;ve !</p>
<p>
<strong>Passionate about code quality, agile and testing ?</strong></p>
<p>
If yes, then this is going very well. We use open source libraries all the time, and hopefully you&rsquo;ve contributed to open source projects (whether bug fixes or full blown contributions).</p>
<p>
<strong>FundApps Technology</strong></p>
<p>
Technology is at the core of everything we do &ndash; we&rsquo;re always looking for opportunities to improve the way we develop software and new tools that help us do that.</p>
<p>
<strong>Our current tech &amp; tools</strong><br />
C#, ASP.NET MVC 4.0, ServiceStack, AngularJS, jQuery, RabbitMQ, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, NCrunch, ReSharper, NuGet, SpecFlow, MSpec, Selenium, Mercurial and Post It notes</p>
<p>
<strong>We&rsquo;re currently evaluating</strong><br />
Chef, StatsD, Logstash, Nginx, Jasmine, RavenDb, EventStore and many others</p>
<p>
<strong>Our future technology;</strong><br />
You decide !</p>
<p>
<strong>Apply</strong></p>
<p>
Love the sound of us? Think we&rsquo;ll love the sound of you? We are super small so the idea of getting hand on &ndash; and making an immediate impact &ndash; should excite you rather than scare you.</p>
<p>
We&rsquo;re ready to be impressed and employ our new Web Developer so contact us and send us your CV.</p>
<p>
NO AGENCIES PLEASE We are very busy so every time we have to stop and talk to you costs us time so please do NOT call or mail us. Honestly, don&rsquo;t.</p>
