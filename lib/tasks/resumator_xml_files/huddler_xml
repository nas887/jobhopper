	About Huddler<br />
	Huddler empowers the most knowledgeable communities on the web with a next generation platform for social sharing and discussion. We partner with established forum communities and migrate their sites onto our hosted service. Our partners, usually the founders of the sites, focus on community and content while Huddler takes over site operations, feature development, and monetization efforts.</p>
<p>
	Huddler is a young but proven startup with a family feel and a bright future. We work hard and play hard. We&#39;re located just steps from the Montgomery BART station in downtown San Francisco.</p>
<p>
	Position Description<br />
	Huddler is growing faster than our existing Operations team can keep up with. We&rsquo;re looking for someone to jump in immediately to assist with several time-sensitive projects, and then transition into a day to day support role once the dust settles. This position is contract to hire. Duties would include, but not be limited to:<br />
	Reception &amp; Office Management - Welcome visitors, answer phones, manage calendars, book travel, oversee vendor relationships, and generally ensure the office runs smoothly<br />
	Hospitality - Manage food and beverage supply to the office, assist with company event planning<br />
	HR &amp; Accounting Support - New hire orientation and set up, filing, and other clerical support as needed</p>
<p>
	This is not a finite position, as this role will most certainly change as the company evolves. It&rsquo;s an excellent starting point with plenty of opportunity to grow within the company. We&rsquo;re looking for candidates with strong technical acumen, an affinity for working independently, and the ability to hit the ground sprinting.</p>
<p>
	Minimum Requirements:<br />
	A bachelor&rsquo;s degree or comparable work experience<br />
	1-3 years experience in a professional or hospitality setting<br />
	Strong technical skills<br />
	Excellent verbal and written communication skills<br />
	A passion for internet technology&nbsp;</p>
