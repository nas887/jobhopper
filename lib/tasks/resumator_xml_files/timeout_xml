	<li>
		Strong experience of templating languages, e.g Twig</li>
	<li>
		Very strong Javascript, with demonstrably good practises in its design and structure, plus use of frameworks including jQuery and Backbone.js.</li>
	<li>
		Experience of CSS frameworks is a bonus.</li>
	<li>
		Good understanding of source code control systems, especially git.</li>
	<li>
		Strong experience with optimising the user experience, predominantly through effective use of front-end technologies</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Additionally we need these skills:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Excellent communication skills, particularly face-to-face</li>
	<li>
		Collaboration</li>
	<li>
		Excellent teamworking capabilities</li>
	<li>
