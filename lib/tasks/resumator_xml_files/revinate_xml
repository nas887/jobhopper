Social media has changed the game for hoteliers. Slick ads no longer fill rooms. Guests now use TripAdvisor and Yelp for recommendations, and tap their networks on Facebook and Twitter. Comment cards on nightstands are nice, but public, online feedback is much richer.</p>
<p>
This new world presents serious challenges, and major opportunities, for hotels across the globe. Revinate is the leading provider of social media solutions for hotels, and we&#39;re just getting started. We&#39;ve got a great, experienced team.

You should also be passionate about social media, have ideas about how the hospitality industry can best leverage various social media technologies, and also have a strong eye for visual design.</p>
<p>
We&#39;re a small team and this is a chance to work in a highly productive environnent. You&#39;ll not only build out front-end features, but drive design and product decisions, and define features from the ground up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br />
<strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Create functional mockups from wireframes and product specifications</li>
<li>
Design, specify and help drive the development of new features &amp; enhancements</li>
<li>
Assist in the creation of&nbsp;new features and enhancements from conception to launch</li>
<li>
Be proactive in improving the product as well as our development processes</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
<strong>Qualifications</strong></p>

<li>
Expert in producing clear, concise, and correct markup, as well as corresponding styling</li>
