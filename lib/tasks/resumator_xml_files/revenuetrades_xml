	<strong><u>About the venture</u></strong>:</p>
<p>
	We let businesses raise money from the public through crowd sourced investment banks. Unlike competitors, we are employing a market pricing mechanism and can provide upside to funders.</p>
<p>
	Our team consists of a visionary product lead, a senior developer with 11 years of Python experience (who is highly influential in the NYC hacker world), and a seasoned community manager who has previously worked with the top angel investment groups in the country.</p>
<p>
	Additionally, we are advised by an executive with over 7 years of private equity experience, an internationally recognized game mechanics and virtual currency expert, and a math PhD algorithmic coder. We are counseled by a top tier venture capital law-firm.</p>
<p>
	<u><strong>About you</strong></u>:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		You think Google&rsquo;s major failure has been an improper incentivization of programming talent since they have to keep buying back Xoogler&rsquo;s to cover talent attrition</li>
	<li>
		You could be a VC and have probably been debating job offers in that category, but you would rather be part of a movement that could be disruptive even to Ycombinator like accelerators</li>
	<li>
		You think that lazy HR betting on educational pedigree is a major market failure in the United States and there is a giant net loss of talent falling through the cracks</li>
	<li>
		You are capable of communicating with extremely intelligent developers and assertive entrepreneurs</li>
	<li>
		You have an innovative financial mind and can grasp new financial products rapidly</li>
</ol>
<p>
	The ideal candidate has established significant relationships with decision makers working in financial institutions, digital media, publishing, and educational/community institutions.</p>
<p>
	Relevant prior experience could include success at a high growth financial technology startup, TMT investment banking (technology, media &amp; telecommunications), and/or significant M&amp;A or business development success at a top media/publishing company that focuses on the finance industry.</p>
<p>
	Prior team building success is a must. Finally, if you are not interested in digital technology trends - this is not the right position for you.</p>
<p>
	<strong><u>About the position</u></strong>:</p>
<p>
	This highly visible role is the perfect opportunity for an individual looking to transition into a scalable financial service startup. Not only will the chosen applicant be enabled to grow the business, but they will be compensated as a founding team member. Furthermore, after an initial on boarding, you will be expected to make the right decisions and take initiative as your effort and strategy will be apparent directly through the platform&rsquo;s growth.</p>
<p>
	The initial responsibility requires the successful applicant to leverage preexisting contacts as potential partnership leads to catalyze the platform&#39;s public launch.</p>
<p>
	<strong><u>In conclusion</u></strong>:</p>
<p>
	Since we are focused on building the core team, we are only offering equity initially. However, since we are only 3 months away from public launch, we will immediately begin generating revenue from which you will be compensated proportionally for your success.</p>
<p>
	For confidential consideration please email a cover letter explaining what has prepared you to take on this position and an attached resume.<br />
