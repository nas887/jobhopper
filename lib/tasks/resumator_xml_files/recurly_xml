Billing is painful. Our software is friendly. We&rsquo;re looking for an outstanding User Experience Design professional to help support our aspiration of masking complexity with simple and elegant user experiences everywhere.</p>
<p>
<strong>What we&#39;re looking for</strong></p>
<p>
We&rsquo;re looking for a person that is passionate about user-centered design challenges.You probably observe them with every new product you use, and take note of both good and bad user experience moments every day.</p>
<p>
You are a design thinker with a strong foundation in all elements of visual communication; typography, layout, color, language etc. More importantly, you have experience that allows you to communicate your own opinions clearly, and draw from your design background to prototype, build and execute. We&rsquo;re looking for thinker/doers, not just thinkers.</p>
<p>
<strong>Specific skills</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Take it from the top: You must understand Type, Layout, Color and Language as well as how to use them effectively in a variety of web interaction models.</li>
<li>
Mastery of your design tools: Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and the like.</li>
<li>
Interaction Design</li>
<li>
Info/Data Visualization, and a strong understanding for visual communication.</li>
<li>
Rapid prototyping &ndash; to post and paste a wall full of flows and directions to get it&nbsp;right.</li>
<li>
You must be a strong communicator; both verbal and written.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>About the role</strong></p>
<p>
This person will lead a key area of Recurly&rsquo;s business, and work directly with all stakeholders to ensure that we&rsquo;re living up to a high user-experience standard across everything we do, and everything we build. This role will span the gamut from Design to Product to Engineering, Support to Marketing, and of course&hellip;Recurly customers.</p>
<p>
You will take the lead early on in our Product Development process, working with Product to ensure that we&rsquo;re identifying the right problems to solve. Your role will help shape the thinking and approach long before any coding begins to prototype user experiences, so that we can solicit feedback from stakeholders. You&rsquo;ll do testing to receive validation and feedback. You&rsquo;re a pro at this.</p>
<p>
In addition, you will play a key role in working with Marketing and Design to unify the Recurly customer experience across all modes of interaction. From Web to App to Email to Invoice.</p>
<p>
Candidates should have at least 5 years of professional experience as a visual designer. You will be expected to have a portfolio of projects in which you have played a leading role in delivering.</p>
<p>
<strong>About Us</strong></p>
<p>
Recurly is a two year old company based in the SOMA district of San Francisco. We have raised $7.6M in venture investment to date, and now power billing for almost 1250 companies worldwide. We are currently 16 employees strong, and the business is growing quickly.</p>
<p>
We enjoy strong coffee, good beer, and have a pool table in the middle of our offices.</p>
<p>
<strong>What We Offer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Competitive Salary</li>
<li>
Equity in a rapidly growing, freshly-funded startup.</li>
<li>
A fun, talented, collaborative and results-oriented team.</li>
<li>
A nice helping of new Apple products, and some serious monitor real estate.</li>
<li>
An office located a block from South Park.</li>
<li>
We happen to sit a lot, so we sit on nice Herman Miller Mirra chairs.</li>
<li>
&lsquo;New Beer Fridays&rsquo;, occasional office massages, and good food for your thoughts.</li>
</ul>
