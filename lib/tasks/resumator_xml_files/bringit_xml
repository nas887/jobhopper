	Senior Software Engineer (for a startup skill-based game monetization engine for social gaming applications)<br />
	San Francisco (South of Market)</p>
<p>
	About BringIt</p>
<p>
	BringIt provides a plug-and-play system which increases monetization and user engagement in any social gaming environment by implementing challenges and tournaments. Users compete in solo skills challenges, head-to-head challenges, or multiplayer tournaments in order to win premium virtual currency that can be spent within the host gaming ecosystem.</p>
<p>
	The BringIt opportunity is enormous. Rather than a business model of one Web site, BringIt aims to be the company that powers any and all social gaming properties &ndash; this represents an equally enormous technology challenge and the reason we are preparing for exceptional growth.</p>
<p>
	BringIt is an early-stage startup with paying customers (several of the Top 10 social gaming companies), established venture capital, and experienced leadership. And we have tremendous opportunities ahead. We are looking to expand our current development team to support new publisher partners, and are hiring key early impact engineers.</p>

	&bull; Design complex data models with relational databases<br />
	&bull; Implement back-end functionality of a database-driven, multi-tiered, service-oriented architecture<br />
	&bull; Implement front-end functionality of interactive and dynamic user interfaces<br />
	&bull; Implement client-side functionality as browser add-ons<br />
	&bull; Utilize standards-based, open-source development stacks<br />
	&bull; Implement back-end functionality to support front-end functions</p>
<p>
	Your Background</p>
<p>
	&bull; 5+ years relevant work experience; e-commerce industry experience, ideally in a high-growth startup<br />
	&bull; Experience building API&#39;s<br />
	&bull; Basic to advanced knowledge of Javascript, Ajax, jQuery, SQL, HTML, DHTML, CSS, PHP, Python, MySQL<br />
	&bull; Good understanding of performance requirements and ability to implement systems with performance and scalability requirements.<br />
	&bull; Python, Django experience preferred<br />
	&bull; Apache experience preferred<br />
	&bull; Any technically relevant personal projects<br />
	&bull; Computer Science undergraduate degree; advanced technical degree preferred<br />
	&bull; Strong background in math and/or statistics<br />
	&bull; Strong database design and theory skills are a plus<br />
	&bull; Strong understanding of Object Oriented Principles</p>
<p>
	Why Join BringIt?</p>
<p>
	&bull; We need to add to our early-stage team to accomplish very big things that can affect all of social gaming.<br />
	&bull; We value innate intelligence, the curiosity to learn more, and the ability to solve problems &ndash; and we provide a ton of autonomy in which to do this.<br />
	&bull; Our team is agile and very supportive. We hire positive engineers who know that we gain the most ground by working together. If you are a disruptive or inflexible person, please apply elsewhere.<br />
	&bull; The social gaming space is big, and will become incredibly large. We have innovated a unique gaming service and see enormous potential for the future. We have done well up to this point and clearly see where we are headed &ndash; and now we need help to get there.</p>
