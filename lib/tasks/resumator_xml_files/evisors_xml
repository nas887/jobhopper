<em><strong>Join the Evisors Team!</strong></em></p>
<p>
As an engineer at Evisors, you&#39;ll be helping people get great jobs by expanding our platform for connecting job seekers with experienced members of their industry. We have the world&#39;s largest network of career advisors and you can help us bring them to the whole world.</p>
<p>
<strong>What you</strong><strong>&#39;ll</strong><strong>&nbsp;be doing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
You&#39;ll be a member of our four person engineering team.</li>
<li>
We have a custom MVC framework and you&#39;ll be helping us expand and improve it. It&#39;ll be maintainable, reliable, and intuitive for the rest of our team to work with.</li>
<li>
Integrating 3rd party APIs, like Twilio, Stripe, and Postmarkapp, Mailchimp, and any other services that help us deliver a great product.</li>
<li>
Test driven development. I mentioned reliability; this is part of how we achieve that goal.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>How we work:</strong></p>
<p>
We&#39;re mostly scrum, using tools like pivotal tracker and fogbugz to manage our development process. Our daily standup meetings give us an opportunity to synchronize on individual tasks and unblock development. We have weekly dashboard meetings to discuss our metrics and to align with overall team and company goals.</p>
<p>
<strong>What you need to get the job:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>A strong CS background</em>. You should have a BS in software or extensive industry experience. Know your data structures &amp; algorithm fundamentals: time/space complexity,&nbsp;binary trees, hashes, etc.</li>
<li>
<em>Applied knowledge</em>. Most college programs don&#39;t cover things like RESTful APIs, XSS/XSRF &amp; HTML/CSS, but they&#39;re essential knowledge to do what we do.</li>
<li>
<em>Problem solving skills</em>. If the above knowledge are the tools, problem solving skills is the capacity to use them.</li>
<li>
<em>Time management skills</em>. In a small company like ours, we&#39;re often working on multiple tasks simultaneously. It&#39;s critical to be able to manage this effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Why Work at Evisors?</strong></p>
<p>
We&#39;re ambituous: we&#39;re working hard to make a product with the power to improve people&#39;s career prospects by democratizing the access to great personal career advisors. We work hard to ship great code and we have fun doing it. You&#39;ll own a part of the company.</p>
<p>
<strong>About Evisors:</strong></p>
