At dotCloud, we believe that containerization will soon become the next big thing, the next tool which will be part of every developer and sysadmin toolbox. What&#39;s &quot;containerization&quot;? The name comes the LXC technology (Linux Containers), and the technique is also known as &quot;Lightweight Virtualization&quot;.</p>
<p>
That&#39;s why we recently launched docker (<a href="http://www.docker.io/">http://www.docker.io/</a>), an Open Source tool enabling anyone to run those Linux Containers very easily. Containers boot 1000x faster than virtual machines; their disk and memory footprint are also much lower; and they work on virtually all current platforms (from physical servers to public cloud instances). We think that they are the future of virtualization, and will soon become ubiquitous.</p>
<p>
Convinced? Then fork the repo on github (<a href="https://github.com/dotcloud/docker">https://github.com/dotcloud/docker</a>) and have a look at the code. Not convinced? Then check the website (<a href="http://www.docker.io/">http://www.docker.io/</a>), which contains more details, demos, and screencasts. Excited about this? Then join our engineering team!</p>
<p>
Your responsibilities will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
being a full-time contributor to the docker project, which means contributing patches, and reviewing and merging pull requests from the community;</li>
<li>
participate in product discussions, influence the roadmap, and take ownership and responsibility over new projects to make them happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can qualify if you...:</p>
<ul>
<li>
can read and write Go code (because docker itself is in Go);</li>
<li>
can read and write Python code (because many tools and services built around docker are in Python);</li>
<li>
are familiar with network protocols: the lower layers like IP, TCP, and UDP; and the higher layers like HTTP;</li>
<li>
have experience in scaling large applications;</li>
<li>
believe that writing unit and functional tests is important.</li>
</ul>
