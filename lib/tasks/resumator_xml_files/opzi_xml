	Opzi is changing the way people at companies share knowledge. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Our product replaces clunky wikis and enables information that was previously trapped in e-mails and the minds of employees to be shared and refined. &nbsp;Based on the simple premise of building products people want to use, we will be a leader in the next generation of enterprise software companies.</p>
<p>
	We are funded by Y Combinator, SV Angel, First Round Capital, and other great investors. &nbsp;We work out of our own loft office space in SOMA, close to the Whole Foods and Caltrain. &nbsp;We code primarily in Ruby + JS and are making heavy use of Node and Backbone. &nbsp;Currently, engineering for functionality, speed, security and scalability are at the top of our minds.</p>
<p>
	We&#39;re looking for great people to add to our all-engineer team. &nbsp;You should have experience building web products and be comfortable across the entire stack. &nbsp;You should also be keen on keeping up with evolving frameworks and best practices. &nbsp;Previous Ruby and Javascript experience is definitely a plus, but certainly not mandatory. &nbsp;We care most that you are smart and passionate about your work and building a new type of enterprise software product.</p>
<p>
	Send me a note at euwyn@opzi.com or use this form on Resumator if this sounds like a good fit. &nbsp;Earn bonus points by solving one of our <a href="http://opzi.posterous.com/tag/puzzles">programming challenges</a>.</p>
