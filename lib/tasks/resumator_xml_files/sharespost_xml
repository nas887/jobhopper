<strong>PRINCIPALS ONLY -- NO RECRUITERS PLEASE</strong><br />
<br />
SharesPost is changing the way companies, investors and shareholders will transact in the pre-IPO economy. We&rsquo;re building a market where the leading private growth companies can satisfy their shareholders&rsquo; desire for liquidity without sacrificing control. Where technology connects companies in need of growth capital with investors in search of growth investments. And where technology and hands-on expertise come together to create efficiencies, accelerate transactions, forge connections, and empower participants.</p>
<p>
SharesPost is hiring Senior Agile Ruby on Rails developers to join our team.</p>
<p>
<strong>Work with cutting-edge technology in a disruptive company</strong></p>
<p>
We are committed to rigorous extreme programming (XP) development with a Rails stack. We have years of experience applying the full suite of XP practices, including TDD/BDD, pair programming, and regular refactoring. We have retrospectives to help us improve our process, and one week iterations.<br />
<br />
Of course, we develop on Macs; we use RubyMine and vim, run rspec integration tests in multiple modes including Selenium, and use Jasmine-driven Javascript including backbone.js and Coffeescript. We use jQuery, and write most of our Javascript as either backbone.js models/views/controllers and/or jQuery plugins. We are investigating big data solutions for our analytics, especially Hadoop. We use Haml &amp; Sass for our views. We use Pivotal Tracker for managing priorities, both customer stories and infrastructure tasks, so everyone shares a common view of the project. The codebase is brand new (no legacy code problems!) and was written test-driven from the ground up.</p>
<p>
<strong>Do you have what it takes to join a highly motivated development team?</strong><br />
<br />
We are looking for great developers who love XP, enjoy sharing knowledge, and want to have some fun with us! Must be basically a cool person who enjoys pairing every day. Easy going, drama free, and patient are all pluses. Passionate -- about anything -- is a huge plus.</p>
<p>
<b>Qualifications</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
Well versed in RoR with a minimum of 1-2 years of RoR experience plus 5 years overall development experience</li>
<li>
BS/CS or equivalent experience</li>

<li>

<li>
You like pair programming</li>
<li>

</ul>
<p>
