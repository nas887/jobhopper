	Urban Dictionary is a slang dictionary with definitions written by visitors. Now in its 12th year, Urban Dictionary serves more than 25 million monthly users and is ranked among the 100 most visited sites in the US by Quantcast.</p>
<p>
	We are looking for help. As an Editorial Intern, you&#39;ll:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Keep up with Urban Dictionary references in popular culture&nbsp;and document them on <strong>blog.urbandictionary.com</strong>.</li>
	<li>
		Post to <strong>facebook.com/urbandictionary</strong>&nbsp;and tweet&nbsp;<strong>@urbandictionary</strong>.</li>
	<li>
		Pick the <strong>Urban Word of the Day,</strong> which appears on our front page, on our facebook page, on twitter and in our email newsletter. When a news story happens, find a relevant Urban Dictionary definition and put it on our internal Urban Word of the Day calendar.</li>
	<li>
		Continue to develop Urban Dictionary&#39;s anti-authoritarian, rebellious personality.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Urban Dictionary does not have an office, so you may work remotely. We welcome applications from anywhere.</p>
<p>
	We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
