	<strong>What is a Scoutmob?</strong></p>
<p>
	Scoutmob&rsquo;s mobile + web platform gives locals an engaging decision-making tool and a connection to their local scene.&nbsp; Our trusted local brand and daily content get people out and exploring their city while giving local merchants a more measurable way to drive new customers.</p>
<p>
	http://scoutmob.com</p>
<p>
	And while we&rsquo;re talking about how great we are, let&rsquo;s just add that we were voted one of Mashable&lsquo;s Top 5 Best Mobile Apps, Rolling Stone&rsquo;s Top 10 Tech Trends for 2011 and are consistently listed among Atlanta&#39;s most promising companies&hellip; among other great publicity.</p>
<p>
	http://mobrumblings.tumblr.com</p>
<p>
	<strong>Who we&#39;re looking for?</strong></p>
<p>
	Scoutmob is hiring engineers to work full-time in our Atlanta, GA headquarters.&nbsp; Our product team is a small but skilled group of hackers and designers, and we&#39;re looking for the best engineers around to help us continue producing beautiful web and mobile products.&nbsp; We are looking for individuals who are self-motivated and eager to learn in a fast-moving environment.&nbsp; This is an opportunity to develop heavily-used products, be autonomous and have substantial decision-making power.</p>
<p>
	This developer role will be responsible for, well, a little bit of everything technical! We&#39;ve got Ruby on the web, iPhone, Android and BlackBerry apps, and an all-cloud server setup. Specialization is good, but so is generalization - everyone necessarily wears many hats. So what would the perfect candidate have?</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		1 Year of experience developing mobile apps for iPhone, Droid or BlackBerry</li>
	<li>
		2 years of web application development (preferably in Ruby, Python, Javascript)</li>
	<li>
		2 years of experience with relational databases, data modeling concepts</li>
	<li>
		Ability to work independently and manage multiple task assignments</li>
	<li>
		Strong oral and written communication skill</li>
	<li>
		Strong problem solving and troubleshooting skills with the ability to exercise mature judgments</li>
	<li>
		Experience with cloud sever based applications preferred but not required</li>
	<li>
		Design experience is a plus, too</li>
</ul>
<p>
	At Scoutmob, we move fast (we have to!), so creating high quality software on-the-fly is a daily thing for us. This means we:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		do a lot of unit testing (frequently TDD)</li>
	<li>
		react to ever-changing requirements (many times a week)</li>
	<li>
		wrangle a growing software/hardware stack geared for scalability</li>
</ul>
<p>
	This is a full-time (awesome) role for the right person with a competitive salary, health benefits, an iPhone, a fantastic workplace and the opportunity to build game-changing products that get used a lot.</p>
