<strong>About Us:</strong></p>
<p>
Shutl is the internet start-up that is changing how we shop online by enabling shoppers to get what they want, when they want it.</p>
<p>
Shutl lets consumers shop at their favourite online stores but receive delivery within 90 minutes of purchase or at a time of the shopper&rsquo;s choice.&nbsp; We operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and can be offered by retailers for a similar price to standard delivery&hellip; sometimes even for free!</p>
<p>
Delivery is cited by 90% of shoppers as their no 1 frustration with shopping online and costs UK retailers billions in delivery failure and lost sales.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re here to make things better.&nbsp; Much better.</p>
<p>
We happen to be one of UK&rsquo;s fastest growing start-ups but we have much greater ambitions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Join us and help change the (delivery) world.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>The Role:</strong></p>
<p>
We are looking for a seasoned consumer product manager who is obsessed with delighting consumers to lead our growing consumer-facing product efforts.&nbsp; This includes our new C2C service as well as all the end consumer touch points across our product suite. A core part of the role will be creating a holistic consumer experience.</p>
<p>
Your job will be to work with our engineering, marketing, sales and service teams, as well as our consumers to launch new products and support existing ones. You will own the strategic positioning of all our consumer products from cradle to grave with responsibility for defining, analysing and tailoring them to meet the requirements of the business. In addition, you will articulate and quantify market problems and opportunities, and lead product delivery and launch efforts.</p>
<p>
You are a person who thrives in a fast moving environment with a heavy dose of ambiguity. Your job will be to bring clarity amidst chaos.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll work closely with the business&rsquo; leadership and product development teams on planning the future direction of Shutl&rsquo;s product offering and value proposition to our consumers. This role requires a strong level of technical competence.</p>
<p>
<strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Leading &amp; developing the Shutl consumer product strategy as its internal and external champion, to deliver on our biz objectives</li>
<li>
Defining, owning and prioritising (collaboratively with the team) the consumer product roadmap to realise product strategy based on short &amp; long term business priorities</li>
<li>
Guide the requirements for everything we build, making sure that features are what our users want, that our designs are usable, and that scope is managed for getting something out the door fast. Defend against feature creep!</li>
<li>
Work with product development as part of an Agile/lean software development process, making sure everyone involved (design, engineering, etc.) has a crystal-clear understanding of the problems we&rsquo;re trying to solve and our customers needs. Whether that&rsquo;s through clickable prototypes, writing user stories, daily stand-ups, or talking with engineers - you&rsquo;re not afraid to shake things up to make sure everyone is working efficiently towards a shared goal.</li>
<li>
Constant review of consumer product portfolio against competitors, market research, technical developments and Shutl&rsquo;s own high standards to identify opportunities to enhance our products and customer experience.</li>
<li>
Recommend new products or product enhancements to maximise the life-time value of Shutl user, drive new customer acquisition and maintain a differentiated product</li>
<li>
Strive for design perfection but love to release and iterate</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Skills:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Hands on. Passionate. Persistent.&nbsp; Creative. Easy to work with.&nbsp; Keen commercial sense.&nbsp;&nbsp; High personal productivity: you are a doer first.</li>
<li>
Ability to balance competing priorities and manage multiple project/deals at the same time.</li>
<li>
Motivated by ambitious goals and know what is needed to hit them</li>
<li>
Analytical. Comfortable with pulling data and building models.</li>
<li>
Strong product vision and an ability to articulate and communicate that</li>
<li>
Enough technical depth to understand the complexity of implementing a feature or product and to engage in trade-off discussions with engineering</li>
<li>
Deep knowledge of agile and lean software product development principles and practices</li>
<li>
BONUS: Programming skills, Design and usability skills</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Experience:</strong></p>
<p>
<br />
This role would suit an up-and coming product manager ready to step up to a bigger stage or an experienced consumer product person.&nbsp; Either way, you will have bags of experience shipping quality consumer products in a fast-paced environment using Agile/Lean.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
You will have minimum of two years consumer product management experience</li>
<li>
You need to be able to thrive in a dynamic start-up environment and while consumer web products experience is critical, experience of how they interact, compliment and link with enterprise products would be helpful.</li>
<li>
BA/BS preferred in Computer Science or a related technical field, MBA a plus</li>
</ul>
