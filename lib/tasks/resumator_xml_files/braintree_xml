What we do...<br />
We help businesses process credit card payments by providing a merchant account, payment gateway, recurring billing tools and credit card storage. The company is disrupting the payments industry by providing elegant tools for developers coupled with white-glove support. We&#39;re unlike others in the industry; we think and do things differently and are frequently told by our customers that we&#39;re not just the best payments support, but the best support *period* that they&rsquo;ve ever encountered.</p>
<p>
A few things about us...<br />
We were founded in 2007, and are very fortunate to count among our customers some of the largest, most reputable, and fastest growing merchants in the U.S such as: LivingSocial, 37signals, OpenTable and GitHub as well as our growing list of international merchants. Our team is now over 100 strong and the company is on track to process more than $5 billion USD in credit card volume in 2012 from more than 2,000 merchants. Braintree was profitably bootstrapped for four years before accepting a $34 million investment from Accel Partners in 2011, and $35 million investment from NEA in 2012. Braintree was ranked 47th in the 2011 Inc. 500. We&rsquo;ve worked unbelievably hard to deliver value and it&rsquo;s paid off.</p>
<p>
Our appealing work environment includes highly competent co-workers, competitive pay, engaging work, casual dress, flexible schedule, full health, vision and dental benefits, and 401k with employer match. We have a dart board, foosball table, and bags (corn hole) in the office. We work very hard and have a lot of fun. We thrive on doing things better, more efficiently, and smarter. We are a flat organization. We don&#39;t have an employee hierarchy or official job titles (you choose your own). We don&#39;t have a vacation policy; we trust people to get their work done and maintain a proper work life balance. We&#39;re not looking for people who want to move into management because we don&#39;t have it.</p>
<p>
We have unusually high expectations of our people. Here are some characteristics that we value in each other...</p>
<ul>
<li>
Self management: both hands are firmly gripped on the steering wheel</li>
<li>
Ownership: I&rsquo;ve got it, you don&rsquo;t need to think about it</li>
<li>
Initiative: getting things done without the slightest nudge</li>
<li>
Virtue: honesty, good deeds, kindness, and appreciation</li>
<li>
Problem Solving: nothing that can&rsquo;t be solved and improved</li>
<li>
Team work: we before I</li>
</ul>
<p>
We will reply to your application, no matter what.</p>
