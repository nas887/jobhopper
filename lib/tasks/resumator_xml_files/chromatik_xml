	Musician Services Manager // Music Education Startup</p>
<p>
	Chromatik (www.chromatik.com) is the new end-to-end platform redefining how people practice, teach and perform music. Chromatik is driving to be the first comprehensive digital environment serving the largely offline music learning and performance market where, in the US alone, nearly 90 million people regularly play music.&nbsp; Chromatik has already been adopted by the hit TV show American Idol, UCLA, the Los Angeles Unified School District, and over 200 other Los Angeles music organizations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We are looking for a passionate individual who loves interacting with customers. The position involves sourcing targeted users (K-12 music teachers, private instructors, and marquee musicians), reaching out directly and guiding them through a happy experience with Chromatik. Next, you will assist with all inbound customer service issues. We expect you will be working with thousands of users, so creativity, fast and articulate communication, and an insane work ethic are paramount. Furthermore, we expect you to manage customer service on a whole - that means creating a process to handle all customer service requests. This position is more than filling a role - it is creating an innovative and flexible program that supports true musicians.</p>
<p>
	Customer outreach doesn&rsquo;t just happen in the office!&nbsp; You will attend music educator conferences around the country and represent Chromatik. You will make in-person demos, speak at events, and represent Chromatik in all facets of the music education community. In order to truly succeed, you must be passionate about music education, customer outreach, customer service, and at least have some formal musical training at some point in your life.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Must Have:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		You are a musician and can talk the talk. This means you&rsquo;ve played music in a formal environment, and can interact with musicians of all levels -- beginners in school, college students, music teachers/directors, symphony musicians, and celebrities.</li>
	<li>
		Fantastic communication and writing skills.</li>
	<li>
		Thrive on high frequency personal interactions -- you have no hesitation speaking about Chromatik to anyone and everyone.</li>
	<li>
		Creative solutions to seemingly insurmountable problems -- you extensively A/B test, utilize a variety of online tools, seek help when needed, and streamline every redundant process.</li>
	<li>
		Love startups and working long hours -- you know what growth-hacking means and dig creative environments that thrive on experimentation, grit, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Great to Have:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Previous startup and/or customer service experience.</li>
	<li>
		You are well read on books and blogs about music and startups -- we expect candidates to demonstrate their passion through obsessive reading and research.</li>
	<li>
		You want to grow. We&rsquo;re a small team. That means a lot of grunt work and doing things yourself. It also means you will gain unparalleled experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The position is located in Santa Monica. Salary and equity are based on previous experience and qualifications. Full benefits are included.</p>

	Growth Manager // Music Education Startup</p>
<p>
	Chromatik (www.chromatik.com) is a venture-backed music technology startup redefining how people practice, teach, and perform music. We&rsquo;re driving to be the first comprehensive digital environment serving the largely offline music learning and performance market where, in the US alone, nearly 90 million people regularly play music. Chromatik has already been adopted by the hit TV show American Idol, UCLA, the Los Angeles Unified School District, and 200 other Los Angeles music organizations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We&rsquo;re looking for a Growth Manager who will cultivate and engage with the music education community to drive demand for Chromatik, both on and offline. In our eyes, a Growth Manager&rsquo;s role is part content marketing, part business development, and part user acquisition/lifecycle management. The Growth Manager&rsquo;s primary driver is to convert musicians to Chromatik users and keep them coming back. End of story.</p>
<p>
	Primary Responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Oversee content development and marketing.</li>
	<li>
		Brainstorm, execute, and measure user acquisition campaigns (customer lifecycle email campaigns, SEO, ad buys, etc).</li>
	<li>
		Manage Chromatik&rsquo;s voice across the web, including on the Chromatik blog, all social media sites, and online communities.</li>
	<li>
		Work with key music education influencers around collaborative Chromatik campaigns.</li>
	<li>
		Develop product tours, instructional videos, and product hooks to help walk users through account activation and use.</li>
	<li>
		Assist with customer service as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Must Have:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		A &ldquo;growth-hacking&rdquo; obsession.</li>
	<li>
		You are a musician and can talk the talk. This means you&rsquo;ve played music in a formal environment, and can interact with musicians of all levels -- beginners in school, college students, music teachers/directors, symphony musicians, and celebrities.</li>
	<li>
		Self-starter and creator who has a knack for getting things done with little direction.</li>
	<li>
		Can write, create, and/or find engaging content for music educators and learners.</li>
	<li>
		You understand grit versus hacking -- you can only hack things to a certain level and know when to put your head down and work.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Great to Have:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		You are a master of customer development and can assemble/build all necessary &ldquo;tools&rdquo; to drive growth.</li>
	<li>
		You have startup and music experience, and read extensively about both.</li>
	<li>
		Photoshop and video editing expertise.</li>
	<li>
		You are a writer-extraordinaire with an engaging voice.</li>
	<li>
		Previously established presence and reputation in the music community</li>
</ul>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The position is located in Santa Monica. Salary and equity are based on previous experience and qualifications. Full benefits are included.</p>
