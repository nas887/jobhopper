<strong>About Goldstar (www.goldstar.com):</strong><br />
Goldstar is the world&rsquo;s largest online seller of half-price tickets to live theater, concerts, comedy and sports. We execute on our core mission to help people go out more by connecting our more than 2 million members with 5,000 live event producers, including everyone from Major League Baseball to Cirque du Soleil. Currently in 30 U.S. cities, we are expanding rapidly. Founded in 2002, Goldstar is headquartered in Pasadena, CA, and is 100% founder, family and employee owned. The work environment is focused, but casual, and the company&#39;s big enough to have a lot of interesting people working in it, and small enough that you&#39;ll know them all.<br />
To truly understand Goldstar it may be easier to think about what we&rsquo;re not.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re not a secondary ticket broker. We&rsquo;re also not a ticket exchange or auction site. And even though we publish discounts and it&rsquo;s free to sign-up for our email newsletter, we&rsquo;re not a daily deals site. Think of us as a club where you&rsquo;re always in-the-know about local events, tipped-off about a cool show, and given access to great deals on tickets. In fact, at Goldstar we like to say that we&rsquo;re not in the business of finding buyers for our tickets; we&rsquo;re in the business of finding tickets for our buyers.</p>
<p>
<br />
<strong>Before applying, we recommend you:</strong><br />
&bull; Develop a thorough understanding of Goldstar&rsquo;s business.<br />
&bull; Read this job description carefully and honestly assess your fit and interest.<br />
&bull; Devote thought to the specific ways in which you&rsquo;re well suited to this role.</p>
<p>
<strong>How to Join Us</strong><br />
Please submit a resume and cover letter detailing why you&rsquo;re interested in this position and why you feel you would be successful in this role. No calls please. Submissions without cover letters will not be considered.&nbsp;</p>
