Dyn seeks a skilled test developer to aid in expanding Dyn&#39;s tests of its email delivery systems. Responsibility currently extends to functional coverage but not performance, including both black- and white-box testing. This is not user-focused or UI testing; testing is primarily of machine-to-machine interfaces and overall back end systems behavior.</p>
<p>
Successful candidates for this position have a good programming background, ideally in Python, in order that they can write test tools easily. Just as important is that the candidate have a knack for spotting important areas to test, and for boiling down test cases so that they are easily reproduced.</p>
