<strong>About the Wego tech team</strong></p>
<p>
The tech team at Wego is a medley of meme-loving developers. We&rsquo;ve contributed back to the open source community with contributions to Ruby on Rails, jQuery, Kohana, MooTools, and many ruby and Node.js libraries. We&rsquo;ve written Chrome and Firefox extensions and also many other tiny and not so tiny apps.<br />
The Role</p>
<p>
At Wego, we believe that specific technical skills are not as important as having the right attitude and motivation to learn. A great developer is easily identified by their passion, attitude and approach to solving problems.</p>
<p>
We&rsquo;re looking for a full-stack developer to join our multi-disciplinary team in Singapore. Most of our technology is built on Ruby on Rails and the JVM but we also dabble in many other technologies (Node.js, Storm, vert.x, Scala, Redis, MongoDB).</p>
<p>
You&rsquo;ll be expected to build scalable and reliable public-facing applications and back-end services. If you like working deep in the stack, you could help us with scaling and architecture for performance and availability. If you enjoy user streamlining, you will also have a role to play building modern, high performance web applications.</p>
<p>
<br />
<strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Able to work at all levels of the technical stack, from back-end coding to front-end styling.</li>
<li>
Proficiency in creating applications in at least one server-side framework: Ruby on Rails (preferred), Node.js, Python, Scala. PHP frameworks are not applicable.</li>
<li>
Experience building distributed systems.</li>
<li>
Experience with JVM languages such as Java and Scala, while not required, is an advantage.</li>
<li>
JavaScript. If you&rsquo;ve used JavaScript with Node.js, also an advantage.</li>
<li>
Solid understanding of the full web technology stack (e.g. HTTP, cookies, headers, asset loading, caching).</li>
<li>
Solid understanding of evented and asynchronous servers and services.</li>
<li>
You use Linux command-line tools and source control (we love Git).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please include your GitHub profile and any apps/personal projects you&rsquo;ve worked on in your application. If this is something you don&rsquo;t possess, please tell us why.</p>
