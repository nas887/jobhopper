	We are looking for a generalist to help us build the platform that powers Blaast. You&#39;ll be working on the magic that gets Blaast running, from network communication, to distributed data handling and process isolation. You have the opportunity to shape how a platform that supports millions of users works. You&#39;ll also be safeguarding that the applications both ourselves and external developers are deploying on Blaast, are automatically provisioned by the platform across our backend, and have the resources to run.</p>
<p>
	Passion for going large scale is a must. You&#39;ll be supported by a team of like-minded people, generalists that have worked in all layers of a system, from kernel, to network stacks, distributed systems, and even UI and applications.</p>
<p>
	This is an opportunity to work on a set of different technology and languages: both the PaaS nature of platform, as well as the visible side of the software: its APIs. If you are looking for a challenge, this is it.</p>
<p>
	We&#39;re building a purely Javascript based platform, bringing many concepts close to web development to the mobile space. Our platform design is very de-coupled, with components being written in either Scala, Java or Javascript, wired together with Thrift or our streaming protocol. All user facing applications run within node.js, which we automatically deploy and scale.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Your responsibilities</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Designing and implementing major platform components.</li>
	<li>
		Guaranteeing the reliability and scalability of the overall system.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Improving existing components, from message passing, to data routing and deployment isolation.</li>
	<li>
		Getting Blaast to scale to the next order of magnitude.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Our mobile framework was built-in house, following a web model. Applications are written in Javascript, both client and backend parts, supported by the Blaast platform.&nbsp;Our backend is implemented in Scala, Java and Javascript (node.js). Our code sits in a Git repository and our philosophy is to automatically deploy anytime our product is better. The team is extremely familiar with Javascript, mobile platforms and high-scale software platforms. We often use existing open source software but are not afraid to build the tools to support our vision.</p>
<p>
	<strong>We Offer</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Competitive salary and stock options.</li>
	<li>
		Work with world-class technology and solve some of its biggest challenges.  </li>
	<li>
		A clean table to try out your ideas and make a difference.</li>
	<li>
		An experienced team to support you.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>We Expect</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		You to be a passionate, capable developer and fearless to tackle most problems.</li>
	<li>
		Ability to participate in a fast-paced, cross-functional team environment.</li>
	<li>
		Experience with Scala, Java, Javascript, Python or Ruby (functional programming a plus).</li>
	<li>
		Experience with event-based frameworks. One of Netty, node.js, Twisted, EventMachine.</li>
	<li>
		Experience in developing high-availability services.</li>
	<li>
		Having previously worked with Amazon EC2 is a plus.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Other Perks and Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Flexible hours, we focus on results.</li>
	<li>
		The best hardware, snacks and weekly lunches/dinners.</li>
	<li>
		We&#39;ll help you settle and find a permanent place to live if you come from abroad.</li>
	<li>
		Blaast&#39;s health care plan, paid holidays.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>About Blaast</strong></p>
<p>
	Blaast is building a cloud-powered mobile platform. We want to enable millions of people, regardless of what mobile device they may own, to access the content they care about.</p>
<p>
	Our platform enables applications to be written to seamlessly execute in a distributed fashion, between client device and our backend. Blaast apps are written completely in Javascript and are true to the web model: fast prototyping, content optimization and scaling across devices. We went one step further and built in some magic to blur the line between frontend and backend.</p>
<p>
	We are well-funded, backed by both experienced angel investors as well as the the founding engineers of Skype. This position is available in our office in downtown Helsinki, Finland. Helsinki is a gorgeous city with a high standard of living. And what&rsquo;s more, Newsweek recently ranked Finland as the world&rsquo;s best country to live in!&nbsp;</p>
