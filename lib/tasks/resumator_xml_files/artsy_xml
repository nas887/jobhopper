	Art.sy seeks a self-motivated, detail-oriented intern to assist with several facets of its operations, with a focus on archive management and research. Interns who demonstrate their capacity will be given opportunities for increased responsibilities, such as contributing to development of The Art Genome Project and working directly with Art.sy&rsquo;s gallery partners.</p>
<p>
	This position is designed for recent graduates with academic training in art history, and ideally, experience working in a gallery environment. At a minimum, candidates should have completed their junior year of undergraduate studies in art history. College graduates or graduate students in art history are preferred.</p>
<p>
	A commitment of 3 days per week is required, but the exact schedule is flexible. This 3 month internship is unpaid, but provides a rare view into the inner workings of a startup and exposure to a roster of leading arts organizations.</p>
