Big Nerd Ranch is a team of expert developers, specializing in training and consulting on mobile development. Over the years, we&#39;ve hosted thousands of students at the Ranch, helped companies around the world realize their programming goals, and released new books in the Big Nerd Ranch Guide Series every year.</p>
<p>
Be aware: Knowledge is the head honcho around here. And <strong>smart, kind folks</strong> who want to make the world a little better through bad-ass development are the only nerds we need.</p>
<p>
So bring us your <strong>brilliant, hard-working</strong> brain! Your elegant non-leaky code! Your crazy passion for <strong>training, consulting and writing</strong> about cutting edge code! (Can you tell we get excited about finding new nerds to join our team?) We&rsquo;ll see if we can carve out a nice little spot for you amongst our nerds-in-residence.</p>
<p>
What you&#39;ll do (Responsibilities):</p>
<ul>
<li>
Develop existing and new mobile applications for Big Nerd Ranch and for our clients</li>
<li>
Author stories (use cases, technical and functional requirements), tests and code</li>
<li>
Contribute to and participate in development meetings (stand-ups, kick-offs, retrospectives) and design sessions with teams and clients</li>
<li>
Collaborate with team members, consultants, designers and clients to provide accurate estimations, timelines and risks associated with development</li>
<li>
Contribute to the open-source community through code, documentation, teaching and speaking</li>
<li>
Write blog posts and code-review your teammates</li>
</ul>
<p>
What you already need to know (Requirements):</p>
<ul>
<li>
Core aspects of Android development including architecture, design, development, separation of layers, configuration, performance, integration and analytics</li>
<li>
Basic Android Development, tools, and how to submit an app to Google Play (Android Market)</li>
<li>
Written and verbal communication skills; strong interpersonal skills are key for success</li>
</ul>
<p>
The benefits we offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Health, dental, vision, life insurance; 401k matching, short- and long- term disability</li>
<li>
Unlimited vacation and a results-only work environment</li>
<li>
Apple laptop and workstation</li>
<li>
Free breakfast and all the caffeine you can consume</li>
<li>
Barista training (we love good espresso; we get ours from Octane Coffee)</li>
<li>
Admission and travel to a conference annually</li>
<li>
On-site personal trainer sessions</li>
</ul>
<p>
And a little something extra:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Super-flexible work hours. As long as you get your work done, you can work from the beach. Really.</li>
<li>
Quarterly team results celebrations like ziplining, rock climbing and more as a team</li>
<li>
Weekly food trucks</li>
<li>
Tech Talks every Friday to keep your skills sharp and teach you new ones</li>
<li>
Doing good in the community by performing service projects or working pro-bono for deserving charities</li>
</ul>
<p>
At the Big Nerd Ranch, you&#39;ll be working hard to improve yourself, and how we work. You&#39;ll be rewarded by working with the smartest people on the planet. We help companies launch and build products that make the world more useful. Are you up to the challenge?</p>
