For information about Cardpool, please check out the <a href="http://www.cardpool.com/jobs" target="_blank">careers page</a>.</p>
<p>
Cardpool.com is looking for engineers to join our talented team of 4 engineers.</p>
<p>
Cardpool makes it ridiculously easy to buy and sell gift cards. In the last 2.5 years, the company has grown from 2 guys in a living room to a company that helps hundreds of thousands of customers buy and sell over $100,000 in gift cards each day. Along the way, our team has grown from 2-4 while staying true to its startup roots.</p>
<p>
We pride ourselves on being an engineering-focused group (with experience @ Apple, Google, Amazon.com, Microsoft, MIT, CMU, UIUC, and Harvard) that moves quickly and builds great customer experiences while having fun along the way. Some of the interesting technical and business challenges we&#39;re working on include real-time inventory management, dynamic pricing problems, high-performance processing of big data, security, data mining, API design, and ping-pong matchmaking algorithms :)</p>
<p>
The ideal candidate would be excited by the prospect of working on a small group of highly technical engineers and enjoy with having a ton of responsibility and learning something new almost daily.</p>
<p>
