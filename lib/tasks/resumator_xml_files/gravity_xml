We&#39;re Jimmy Vee &amp; Travis Miller, co-founders of Gravitational Marketing and Rich Dealers. We run a rapidly growing advertising agency and creative services company serving the automotive industry. We&#39;re looking for an experienced, results-driven inside sales superstar to help us recruit new clients.</p>
<p>
Think you&rsquo;ve got what it takes? Then keep reading...</p>
<p>
<br />
<strong>Position Summary:</strong></p>
<p>
The Sales Advisor will be responsible for initiating new relationships with potential clients for our training division, which provides coaching and sales training to executives of retail automotive dealerships and sales people in North America.</p>

<strong>To Be Considered You Must:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Have a proven track record of exceeding goals, closing sales, and developing strong relationships</li>
<li>
Have at least 3 years experience selling high dollar products or services (years of experience matter less that proven results)</li>
<li>
Be a dynamic professional who knows how to have engaging conversations and ask thought-provoking questions</li>
<li>
Be willing to make one more call after everyone else would have given up</li>
<li>

<p>
<br />
<strong>What You&rsquo;ll Be Doing:</strong></p>
<p>
As a new advisor, you&#39;ll start &quot;learning the ropes&quot; by opening new relationships; that is, reaching out to cold and (sometimes) warm prospects, asking questions, offering an analysis and helpful advice. In the beginning you&#39;ll be setting appointments for closers. As you grow more comfortable and confident talking to our prospects, as you develop an understanding of what we offer, as you prove your commitment and dedication, you&#39;ll start training to be a closer.</p>
<p>
Your job will be to hunt. We, along with our ultra talented team of client services pros, will take care of everything else.</p>
<br />
<p>
<strong>Our Sales Advisors Enjoy:</strong></p>
<ul>

Competitive Compensation &ndash; guaranteed hourly wage, plus bonus. Once you start closing deals, the money goes up. Closers realistically earn $100,000 first year, and over $200,000 is possible for performers.</li>

<strong>Company Description:</strong></p>
<p>
Gravitational Marketing was founded in 2004 by two former college roommates who knew there was a better way to attract customers. The company&#39;s mission is to make life and business ESP&shy;&shy;&mdash;Enjoyable, Simple &amp; Prosperous. In 2008 the company narrowed its focus to serving retail automotive dealers. Why? Because car dealers are big advertisers! It&#39;s the biggest opportunity to leverage our superpower, which is creating mass media strategies that get incredible results.</p>
<p>
Gravitational Marketing was #628 on the 2012 Inc. 500/5000 list of America&#39;s fastest growing companies. We&#39;re strong, stable, nimble and quick. And we have a ton of fun.</p>
<p>
Founders, Jimmy Vee and Travis Miller, are authors of multiple bestselling books and have presented to audiences around the world.</p>
