We&#39;re doing some really cool things for a fast growing (nearly profitable), VC backed, business that was recently named one of Forbes&#39;s 100 most promising companies. Our stack is Ruby, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Node and Redis. We practice continuous deployment (deploying to production multiple times a day). We also are very proud of our open-source contributions especially github.com/crowdtap/promiscuous.</p>
<p>
We work in small autonomous teams where the engineers are involved from the very beginning and are expected to heavily influence the product and see it through from idea to validation and optimization. Finally, and most importantly, we value work-life balance by working reasonable hours and encourage side projects.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>Passion</strong>: You must love building web applications and solving both hard technical and product problems to deliver a product that you can be proud of.</p>
<p>
<strong>Ability to Learn quickly</strong>: Our stack is Ruby but we&#39;re always trying out different technologies to ensure we&#39;re using the best tool for the job. That means that we&#39;re not as concerened whether you have a perfect match against our current stack vs. how quickly you can pickup new things. We&#39;ve converted (I mean onboarded) Java, Python and .Net engineers.</p>
<p>
<strong>Be family</strong>: Everyone on the team enjoys be around each other. We have lunch with each other, we go out for drinks every now and again and we love celebrating successes together. Whoever joins the team needs to fit in.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
