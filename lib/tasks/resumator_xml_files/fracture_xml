<u><strong>Who is Fracture?</strong></u><br />
Fracture is re-inventing the way consumers print and display their digital images. Our first product, printed glass &quot;Fractures&quot;, allow you to print your images directly onto glass and have them shipped right to you in our custom designed packaging. Check it out at www.fractureme.com.</p>
<p>
We&#39;ve sold over 100,000 fractures to 20,000 customers in the past 2.5 years, but this is just the beginning. We&#39;re just scratching the surface of our potential. Our uniqueness stems from the fact that we actually design, engineer, and manufacture something tangible. Real. But that&#39;s what we love about what we do. We&#39;re what vertically integrated, lean consumer manufacturing can become.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We&#39;re looking for a Web Leader to lead our web development efforts and be the champion of our customer&#39;s web experience.</p>
<p>
<u><strong>Who is the ideal Web Leader?</strong></u><br />
- You have proven experience and a passion for the design and execution of an e-commerce website.<br />
- You consider yourself a hands on leader with both a view from 30,000&#39; and an understanding at 30&#39;.<br />
- You know how to manage a team of web developers (programmers, designers, etc.) and collaborate extensively with Marketing, Sales, and executive.<br />
- You are an evangelist in the realm of UI/UX best practices, usability testing, SEO integration, and website optimization.<br />
- You are an avid analytics and data collection activist.<br />
- You can recruit an amazing team of web developers.<br />
- You mesh with our goals and principals, embrace our challenges and limitations and know how to prioritize start-up style.<br />
- You want to work your hardest and become the best.</p>
<p>
<u><strong>Some of the websites we really admire:</strong></u><br />
- Moo.com<br />
- Mailchimp.com<br />
- Mint.com<br />
- Workfu.com<br />
- Apple.com<br />
- Squareup.com<br />
- Nest.com<br />
- Path.com</p>
<p>
<u><strong>What&#39;s in it for you?</strong></u><br />
- The opportunity to be a part of the revolution in actually making something real. In a world of cloud-based, digital, virtual currency purchased, gamified goods and services, you&#39;ll be responsible for developing platforms that bring people&#39;s visual memories into the real world. Quit leading the next geo-location based, social media RSS aggregator app. Do something real with us.</p>
<p>
- Real opportunity for making something consequential. Real authority to make your own decisions. Real responsibility. Real-world consequences.</p>
<p>
- A challenge like none other. You&#39;ll be pushed to your limits as you combine the very distinct worlds of e-commerce and manufacturing into a web experience that&#39;s unparalleled. Jump in head first and deep dive into learning what it takes to dream, conceptualize, prototype, engineer, design, sell, market, and scale a consumer product on an international scale. There are no silos here, and you&#39;ll see it all. We&#39;ll push you to discover the true depths of your skills and talents.</p>
<p>
- Salary is commensurate with experience, and we&#39;ll pay you what you need to live and to keep going. Need more? Prove your worth and we&#39;ll make sure to reward you for your work and results. Every single one of us is in this because of the opportunity at hand. You&#39;ll get meaningful equity in a fast-growing company in one of the fastest-growing sectors in business. 80 billion photos were taken in 2011, and smartphone cameras are only getting stronger and richer in quality each year. Photos are people&#39;s #1 social asset. The company that figures out how to tap into people&#39;s photos and use them to create disruptive, innovative, and affordable photo-products will completely change the photo industry. We believe that&#39;s us.</p>
