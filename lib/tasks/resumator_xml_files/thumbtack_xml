We are looking for a full stack software engineer to join our engineering team. As a full stack engineer, you will be responsible for building new products and features to help service pros and their clients connect in new and beneficial ways. In some ways, this is a liberal arts position: you will be working with a variety of tools and with people from all across the company. Your job may change daily (or monthly), and you&rsquo;ll be exposed to many aspects of Thumbtack&rsquo;s products and business. You will work closely with our users and with your colleagues at the company to find creative ways to make the process of finding and booking a service pro easier than ever before.</p>
<p>
If we do our job right, the Yellow Pages will be a thing of the past and we&rsquo;ll introduce real efficiency into the local services market.</p>
<p>
Our process gives you full ownership over the product and features you build: so dream big, then execute well. Our engineering team values risk taking, fast iterations, and data-driven decisions. We empower individuals to be creative and independent. You can learn more about some of the projects we&rsquo;ve worked on over at our tech blog: <a href="http://www.thumbtack.com/engineering">thumbtack.com/engineering</a></p>
<p>
About you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
You like finding interesting problems in the world, then tackling them head on with dedication and creativity</li>
<li>
You are comfortable expressing yourself with written and verbal communication</li>
<li>
You like talking and engaging with users to help them express their needs in ways that can be used as feedback for future iterations of the product</li>
<li>
You&rsquo;re not one to pick up a hammer then look for nails, though you do like finding new hammers</li>
<li>
You appreciate a good statistical analysis and the power of data-driven decisions, and you like running A/B tests</li>
<li>
You&rsquo;re excited about the code you write, and work hard to make it maintainable for your future self as well as your colleagues on the engineering team</li>
<li>
You&rsquo;re comfortable working in a variety of languages and systems (we use a mix of PHP, Python, JavaScript, Postgres, and Mongo)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Does this sound like you? We&rsquo;d be incredibly excited to hear from you.</p>
<p>
We encourage you to complete one of our <a href="http://www.thumbtack.com/challenges">programming challenges</a> and send it with your resume to <a href="javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(99,111,100,101,99,104,97,108,108,101,110,103,101,115,64,116,104,117,109,98,116,97,99,107,46,99,111,109))">codechallenges@thumbtack.com</a>.</p>

As a front-end engineer at Thumbtack, your varied skills and our bottom-up product process will give you as much autonomy and license as you can handle. If you can build it and it&rsquo;s good for the company, do it! There&#39;s no limit to how valuable you can be or how much of an effect you can have here.</p>
<p>
We want people who want to make their mark on the world, who are itchy, who tinker. We want people with the ambition to dream big and the talent to see those dreams through.</p>
<p>
Some things about you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
You see the web as a beautiful, intricate, occasionally clumsy Rube Goldberg machine. Working with it isn&rsquo;t a chore; it&rsquo;s a challenge.</li>
<li>
You&#39;re perfectly comfortable with all the normal front-end technologies (JavaScript and its derivatives, CSS, semantic HTML, etc) but don&rsquo;t mind the occasional jumps into PHP, Python, or database queries.</li>
<li>
You spend almost as much time inspecting a page&#39;s elements and figuring out how it works as you do using it. You&#39;re insatiably curious about how websites are made and what they&#39;re made of.</li>
<li>
You think complaining about IE support is so five years ago. You know exactly how, when, and when not to play nice across different browsers and platforms.</li>
<li>
You keep abreast with modern web practices and trends but know when to stay pragmatic in their implementations.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The ideal candidate is excited about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Clean, accessible, understandable markup</li>
<li>
A/B testing, data-driven decision making</li>
<li>
Responsive web design</li>
<li>
Graceful degradation, progressive enhancement</li>
</ul>
<p>
Bonus points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
A portfolio of real, live projects; contributions to open-source</li>
<li>
An eye for design, or at least a good appreciation for it</li>
<li>
An ability to identify workflow pain-points and create tools that solve them</li>
</ul>
<p>

Try one of our <a href="http://www.thumbtack.com/challenges">code challenges</a>, then send its solution and your resume to <a href="javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(99,111,100,101,99,104,97,108,108,101,110,103,101,115,64,116,104,117,109,98,116,97,99,107,46,99,111,109))">codechallenges@thumbtack.com</a>.</p>

As a back end engineer at Thumbtack, you&rsquo;ll be excited about building fast, scalable, and robust systems to support product and business objectives. You&rsquo;ll be working with both our marketplace users and our internal teams.</p>
<p>
Much of what you&rsquo;ll be working on could be considered infrastructure. It could also be considered &ldquo;magic&rdquo; or &ldquo;secret sauce&rdquo; or &ldquo;wizardry&rdquo;. One project might involve a swan dive into a Mongo dataset, another might be writing a massively parallel system in EC2 to crawl the web, and yet another might be building a recommender system to better match consumer requests with service pros. In other words, you won&rsquo;t be spending your time fiddling with floats or CSS3 pseudo-elements (unless you want to!).</p>
<p>
We expect you to be excited by Thumbtack&rsquo;s mission to transform the local services economy, making it more efficient and useful for both sides of the marketplace. We deeply believe in the transformative power of technology in the services industry.</p>
<p>
Our engineering process values ownership and individual contribution within a collaborative environment. To this end, you will have a lot of choice in the kinds of projects you take on, we expect you to take a deliberate and thoughtful approach to your decision-making while also exercising great freedom and creativity. We hope that you&rsquo;ll enjoy crafting sentences and paragraphs as much as you enjoy crafting methods and classes.</p>
<p>
Technologies we currently use: Python, Postgres, Mongo, loose leaf tea.</p>
<p>
If you are interested in this position, we encourage you to complete one of our <a href="http://www.thumbtack.com/challenges">code challenges,</a> and send your solution and resume to <a href="javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(99,111,100,101,99,104,97,108,108,101,110,103,101,115,64,116,104,117,109,98,116,97,99,107,46,99,111,109))">codechallenges@thumbtack.com</a>.</p>

Thumbtack has access to an enormous set of data about the U.S. local services industry that is unique in its volume, depth, and quality. We have previously used that data to partner with outside organizations who have helped us develop and implement surveys, beautiful interactive visualizations, and white papers on the state of the U.S. local service economy. These data are exciting and useful to policymakers, lawmakers, and the media because this is an enormous sector of the economy that has traditionally been difficult or impossible to measure due to the inability to reach workers in this often-informal economy.</p>
<p>
<br />
Check out our Small Business Friendliness Survey that we have conducted for two years in partnership with the Kauffman Foundation for an example of the work we do with our data.</p>
<p>
<br />
We are looking for an extremely talented, self-motivated individual with a strong background in economics who is excited about maintaining our current research projects and creating new ones. You would be entirely responsible for shaping and building two or three large data projects annually, gathering and cleaning the data, writing and publishing white papers presenting the results of the projects, coordinating with an outside design firm to create and implement interactive data visualizations, and promoting these projects to and responding to inquiries from thousands of media outlets nationwide.</p>
<p>
<strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Manage and re-implement the Small Business Friendliness Survey that we conduct in partnership with the Kauffman Foundation; lead our relationship with the Kauffman team.</li>
<li>
Create and release quarterly an index of local service prices akin to the CPI and build/publish in partnership with a major financial media outlet or economics-focused organization.</li>
<li>
Evaluate and execute new opportunities to partner with major economics-focused organizations or media outlets and publish new data.</li>
<li>
Develop and revise current and new surveys; clean large amounts of raw data in partnership with our team in the Philippines; produce hundreds of press releases; lead relationships with outside partners; manage production of data visualizations by outside design firm.</li>
<li>
Contact and respond to thousands of newspaper, TV, and radio reporters nationwide for each of these projects - a substantial part of this role would be media relations.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in economics-related subject; strong stats background</li>
<li>
Strong interpersonal, writing, and managerial skills - you will need to be smart in formulating press pitches, articulate in talking to reporters, and able to manage a team in the Philippines that is dedicated to supporting and scaling you and your work.</li>
<li>
Excitement about owning - and doing the hard work to accomplish - the success of a variety of econ-focused research projects that use large amounts of data in order to promote Thumbtack&rsquo;s brand and marketing efforts nationwide.</li>
<li>
The ability to take feedback constructively, not personally - we have an always-be-learning attitude at Thumbtack.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Bonus Points</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Master&rsquo;s degree in economics-related subject</li>
<li>
Experience in building or working with a pricing index or price indices</li>
</ul>

There are only two kinds of truth in the world: philosophical truth and statistical truth. Philosophical truth draws on pure reason; statistical truth draws on data. Philosophical truth can be hard to apply to business, but statistical truth lies at the very heart of Thumbtack. Our collective reverence for the power of statistical analysis is, we believe, one of our key advantages as a business and one of the primary drivers of our success.</p>
<p>
What is a &quot;data scientist&quot;, anyway? Well, it&#39;s &quot;data&quot; and &quot;scientist&quot;:</p>
<p>
<strong>Data:</strong> &quot;Only the data are real&quot;. Unfortunately, most data are extremely unwieldy. Drawing correct conclusions from data requires a sharp analytical mind, a deep understanding of the fundamentals of statistics, and a broad toolbox of statistical and machine learning techniques. It also requires the engineering skill to wrangle data from various sources and to implement computationally-challenging algorithms over large data sets.</p>
<p>
<strong>Scientist:</strong> A scientist practices the scientific method: formulating hypothesis, testing them, and drawing inspiration for new hypothesis from the results. This requires the scientist to use both sides of her brain in tandem, creatively coming up with useful hypotheses and analytically testing, rejecting, revising and expanding them in a continual interplay. A great scientist doesn&#39;t simply analyze data to answer a question. A great scientist finds the incredibly valuable questions no one had thought of.</p>
<p>
<br />
We&#39;re looking for a brilliant individual to form the cornerstone of our data science team here at Thumbtack. Our process gives you full ownership over the projects you tackle: so dream big, then execute well.</p>
<ul>
<li>
You&#39;ll be given the latitude to survey Thumbtack as a business, identify key opportunities, and use any and all available data to draw actionable conclusions that will guide the direction of the company.</li>
<li>
You&#39;ll design, implement and launch experiments to test your hypotheses.</li>
<li>
You&#39;ll identify and implement metrics that align with company goals.</li>
<li>
You&#39;ll contribute to our Python codebase and perform analyses in R or another statistics tool of your choice.</li>
<li>
You&#39;ll advise coworkers on the (mis)use of statistics to understand data.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If we do our job right, the Yellow Pages will be a thing of the past and we&#39;ll introduce real efficiency into the local services market.</p>
<p>
Here are a few example projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Which markets in our ecosystem are most healthy? Which are least healthy and how can we improve them?</li>
<li>
Are service providers becoming more or less engaged with Thumbtack over time? What&#39;s driving these changes?</li>
<li>
Which consumers are most delighted by their Thumbtack experience? What drives the differences and how can we best improve the experience for our users?</li>
<li>
Are some service providers consistenly under- or over-charging for their services? How does that affect consumer behavior? Could we offer advice to help them improve their businesses?</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>About you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
You&#39;re proficient with advanced statistical analysis and machine learning techniques in an environment/tool/language of your choice (we use R and Python/Pandas currently).</li>
<li>
You have a deep understanding of probability and statistics.</li>
<li>
You have the analytical chops to break down big, open-ended problems into manageable pieces, then attack the pieces from a variety of angles, all without losing sight of the bigger picture.</li>
<li>
You&#39;re comfortable working with a large, complex code base (we use Python)</li>
<li>
You express yourself clearly and concisely in written and verbal discussion of complex problems.</li>
<li>
This job description resonates with you.</li>
</ul>

Thumbtack is looking to build an amazing mobile experience for hundreds of thousands of users. Both sides of the Thumbtack marketplace (service providers and their clients) will benefit massively from enhanced mobile experiences. Imagine what you might do if you could run your business from your iPhone? If you could hire a service provider at any time day or night with just a few taps? The sky is the limit.</p>
<p>
The front-end team at Thumbtack invests heavily in responsive web design and fast, elegant mobile experiences. We&rsquo;ve seen this investment pay off incredibly. But we think we can do better with a fully native experience.</p>
<p>
We&rsquo;re looking for someone who&rsquo;s built great iOS experiences in the past. We&rsquo;re new to this, so need some guidance. That said, you&rsquo;ll be working with great engineering and design teams who will be eager to assist you in making something really exceptional.</p>
<p>
Specifics about you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Excellent iOS/Objective-C engineer who is passionate about great design</li>
<li>
Have released apps on the App Store. We&rsquo;re looking for someone who&rsquo;s done this before.</li>
<li>
Excited by the potential of mobile technology to transform the lives of small businesses around the country.</li>
<li>
Great communicator. We find that people who are good writers tend to be great thinkers and great coders.</li>
