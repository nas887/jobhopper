It is the developer of OWLIM &ndash; the most scalable semantic database engine, as well as platforms for semantic annotation. Ontotext&rsquo;s technology delivers real-world applications in Life Sciences, Financial Intelligence, Telecommunications, Publishing, Media, Online Recruitment, Web Search, and other areas.

<strong>Job description</strong></p>
<p>
RDF databases represent a next-generation database management technology. While relational databases deal with tables, i.e. n-ary relationships, RDF offers a more abstract graph data model. The latter was designed and standardized by the W3C to be the data format for Web 3.0 &ndash; a World Wide Web of structured data. Ontotext is the developer of OWLIM that is globally recognized as one of the most robust and efficient RDF database servers.</p>
<p>
Ontotext are looking to expand the OWLIM team with experienced Java developers, who have a background in commercial software development, to further evolve the OWLIM database using the Java programming language. Responsibilities include software design, implementation, testing (JUnit) and engagement in the full software development life-cycle.</p>
<p>
Ontotext enjoy a healthy and productive relationship with a broad range of customers, e.g. the BBC, the United Nation&#39;s Food and Agriculture Organization, (and many more). After a suitable period, OWLIM developers will gain some amount of exposure to these users for the purpose of planning new database features and occasional 3rd level technical support.</p>
<p>
Software development will be highly varied, covering topics such as indexing and caching algorithms, highly concurrent data structures, geo-spatial modelling, graph-analysis, text-analysis and integration with 3rd party components for document indexing/retrieval.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
team player</li>
<li>
competence in modern software development practices</li>
<li>
good communicator</li>
<li>
excellent English skills</li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Advantageous experience</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
programming server and/or database systems</li>
<li>
familiarity with multi-threaded programming concepts and problems</li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This is a unique opportunity for an experienced, multi-talented software developer to help shape next generation technology. We offer a competitive salary and encourage you to pursue further academic or IT qualifications. If you are interested, please feel free to send us your CV and a motivation letter!</p>
