<p>
Our product design is driven by efficacy research in second language acquisition, but we are truly differentiated in the language market by our cutting edge technology platform, serving web and native Android and iOS clients.&nbsp; We are building a scalable service oriented platform around patented algorithms, not a cardboard box around a CD-ROM, so our tech-driven startup culture is unique in the language education market.&nbsp; Members of the backend team solve hard problems using a bewildering array of open source software, here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been using in the last 6 months: mongodb, postgresql, redis, rabbitmq, beanstalkd, elastic search, hadoop+pig+EMR, numpy/scipy/scikit-learn, NLTK, memcached, varnish, nginx, uwsgi, python, gevent, bottle.py, django, fabric, chef, jenkins+nose and naturally it&rsquo;s all checked into git.</p>

Relational and non-relational data design that is performant and extensible</li>
<li>
SQL fluency is a big plus (there&rsquo;s some PostgresQL here), but we primarily use mongodb and redis.</li>
<li>
Penchant for testing, measurement and instrumentation; you strive to build fast code with few errors which is easy to analyze and debug in production.</li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Bonus round</strong></p>
<p>
In order to turn real world content into language learning tools we employ a number of interesting computational methods: NLP; Information Retrieval; Graph algorithms; Machine Learning; Map/Reduce-driven analysis.&nbsp; Members of the engineering team are encouraged to learn about these areas and contribute to the core IP of the product.</p>
