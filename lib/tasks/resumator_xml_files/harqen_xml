			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Here's the deal ...</strong></em></p>
<p>A little more than three years ago, we here at HarQen created a powerful and simple way to use web-telephony platform. What's that? Exactly! We were very excited about it, but when we jumped up and down bragging about it, most people heard, "We have created a powerful and easy to use blah blah blahbely blah." Fortunately, the world is changing fast and now our customers hear, "Managing voice differently will significantly improve the way you do business!"  In short, the next generation of voice is here.</p>
<p><em><strong>Who cares?</strong></em></p>
<p>Hey, no need to be rude!  But if you don't care, you can stop reading now and go back to your search for the exciting mega-corporation that is committed to customer empowerment and leveraging dynamic mindshare solutions to change the paradigm!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, HarQen will be over here in Milwaukee building our incredibly cool voice platform that is already making a huge difference for some very big, global companies.  We are very proud of what we are doing and are excited to help change the world (literally!) with the things that we are making.</p>
<p><em><strong>That's great, but I'm not reading this for my health. I want a job!</strong></em></p>
<p>That's what we want to hear! As it turns out, world domination is hard and we need help. We are growing fast and need some help selling our flagship product, VoiceScreener (www.voicescreener.com). The marketing docs say:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><a title="VoiceScreener by HarQen" href="http://www.voicescreener.com/?utm_source=theResumator&amp;utm_medium=Web_Job_Boards&amp;utm_campaign=Test" target="_blank">VoiceScreener</a> lets busy HR professionals use their phone and a simple dashboard to create and distribute custom, pre-recorded interviews.  Thanks to VoiceScreener, candidates are able to anywhere and the entire hiring team can compare candidates' responses via an easy to navigate web interface.</em></p>
<p>In short, it's cool, it's easy to use and it is making the early interview process better for candidates AND hiring managers. (And best of all, if you are interested in working with us, you'll get to try it for free!) So that's the story. Our little company is breaking away from the constraints of traditional telephony. This is our Jerry McGuire moment. We're asking "Who's coming with us?"</p>
<p>All we can promise is a fast-paced, challenging environment, full of smart people, in which we're willing to pull all-nighters to find new clients and make them extremely happy that we did find them. Opportunities to join a team like this are rare for a reason!</p>

<li>Ability to conduct engaging and concise product demonstrations as part of the daily sales process.</li>
<li>Willingness to work collaboratively to develop impactful sales presentations.</li>
<li>Demonstrated desire to win and an ability to persevere in the face of rejection. (Remember this is a new industry! When they get it, they really get it. Before that...well that's where the ability to handle rejection will come in handy.)</li>
<li>Proven ability to overcome a variety of objections to get to the "Aha!"</li>
<li>Ability to thrive in a startup environment.</li>
<li>Ability to translate feedback from customers and prospects into information that the development team can use to improve the product. (We want your input!)</li>
