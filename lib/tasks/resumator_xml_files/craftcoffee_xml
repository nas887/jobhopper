Craft Coffee pioneered a new kind of coffee-of-the-month subscription. We bring our subscribers coffees from dozens of different roasters with an unprecedented focus on quality. The Craft Coffee experience is simply not available anywhere else.</p>
<p>
We&#39;re supported by amazing investors and we&#39;ve been featured in The Wall Street Journal, Martha Stewart&#39;s Everyday Food, Bon Appetit, Saveur, Daily Candy, Techcrunch, Tasting Table, Serious Eats, Food52 and more.</p>
<p>
<strong>The Goals of this Position</strong><br />
We are driven to bring amazing coffee to every coffee drinker.&nbsp; There are a lot of questions to be answered. What is good coffee? Why is bad coffee bad? How should I grind it? What should I grind it with? How should I brew it? What should I brew it with? How much coffee? How much water?&nbsp; How much time? The questions go on and on.</p>
<p>
A lot of our friends in the world of coffee have taken a very technical approach to answering these questions.&nbsp; We think that alienates new people, rather than welcoming them.&nbsp; As curators of the finest coffees in the world, that approach doesn&#39;t jibe with our mission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We want to grow the tent, expand the audience.&nbsp; We want to build a lifestyle where your morning coffee will be a moment of joy in your day, something that you&#39;ll look forward to every day.&nbsp; Something you would never compromise.</p>
<p>
<strong>Are you right for this position?</strong><br />
We are looking for a highly motivated, food obsessed, powerhouse intern. You will have a tremendous amount of responsibility -- real responsibility.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t come to this with self-motivation and show exceptional innitiative, you&#39;re not going to be the right fit for this role.</p>
<p>
You&#39;ll be an innovator in how coffee experiences can be communicated and conveyed to a large audience.&nbsp; We&#39;ll ask you to think way, way outside existing paradigms, question assumptions, and present information to our customers better than anybody has ever done it before in our industry.</p>
<p>
You&#39;re a storyteller.&nbsp; And you can clearly convey elements of a story in an engaging and understandable way.</p>
<p>
You need not be part of the coffee industry. &nbsp;In fact, we prefer a candidate who is not part of the coffee industry, but is passionate about food and also about conveying experiences to others. &nbsp;But you must, absolutely must, be a regular coffee drinker.</p>
<p>
You also need to be reliable. We&#39;re looking for someone to come in at least 15-20 hours per week.</p>
<p>
You will work out of our new office in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Look forward to being surrounded by good food and hanging on the roof deck this summer.</p>
<p>
This position is open to only candidates in New York City.</p>
<p>
<strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Intensive product testing (including coffee brewing and machine testing)</li>
<li>
Writing manuals, guides, and other information for our customers</li>
<li>
Developing a library of materials on best practices for every element of the coffee experience</li>
<li>
Synergizing all of this technical information into formats that are helpful for our customers</li>
<li>
Logging all of the results of your tests in useful formats</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Experience/Education</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Current undergrad student (pref rising junior or senior) or recent grad</li>
<li>
Writing experience (published clips and/or personal blog)</li>
<li>
Experience creating and editing online video is a big plus</li>
<li>
Culinary experience is a plus</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Knowledge/Skills</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Excellent copywriting skills</li>
<li>
You must be very fluent in modern formats of conveying information (blogging platforms, social media, video, etc.)</li>
<li>
Strong attention to detail</li>
<li>
Excellent communication skills</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Why Craft Coffee?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
This is your chance to get extremely creative and apply that creativity in a practical environment that will touch thousands of people.</li>
<li>
You will have a tremendous amount of responsibility and a real impact on our business.</li>
<li>
We have an endless supply of the best coffee in the world. Seriously.</li>
<li>
Spend the summer working out of Williamsburg, Brooklyn!</li>
</ul>
